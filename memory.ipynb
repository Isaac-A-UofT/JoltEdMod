    "Welcome, third-year computer science students! Today we are going to talk about memory complexity in C programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Memory complexity refers to the amount of memory required by a program to execute. In other words, it's like packing for a trip. Just as you wouldn't want to pack too much or too little for a trip, a program needs to have the right amount of memory to function properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of your brain as the computer's memory. When you pack your bag for a trip, you have to decide what items to bring and how much space they will take up in your bag. Similarly, a program has to decide what variables and data it needs to store in memory and how much space they will take up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say you packed too much for your trip and your bag is overflowing. This can make it difficult to move around and find what you need. The same thing can happen to a program if it uses too much memory. It can slow down the program and make it less efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you don't pack enough for your trip and forget important items, you may not have what you need to enjoy your trip. The same thing can happen to a program if it doesn't use enough memory. It may not be able to store all the necessary data and variables, and the program may not work correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, just like packing for a trip, a program needs to have the right amount of memory to function properly. It's important to consider memory complexity when writing a program to ensure it runs efficiently and effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this metaphor helps you understand memory complexity in C programs. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!"

    "# Memory Complexity for C Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory complexity refers to the amount of memory that a program requires to run. In C, memory allocation is done manually using functions like `malloc()` and `free()`. It is important to manage memory efficiently to avoid memory leaks and runtime errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example to understand memory complexity in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",
    "#include <stdlib.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    int n;\n",
    "    printf(\"Enter the size of the array: \");\n",
    "    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n",
    "\n",
    "    int *arr = (int *) malloc(n * sizeof(int)); // allocating memory for the array\n",
    "\n",
    "    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n",
    "        printf(\"Enter element %d: \", i);\n",
    "        scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    printf(\"The array elements are: \");\n",
    "    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n",
    "        printf(\"%d \", arr[i]);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    free(arr); // freeing the memory allocated for the array\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, we ask the user to input the size of an array and then allocate memory for that array using `malloc()` function. The `sizeof()` function is used to calculate the size of an integer in bytes, and we multiply it by the number of elements to allocate the exact amount of memory required.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use a `for` loop to input the elements of the array and print them back to the user. Finally, we free the memory allocated for the array using the `free()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory complexity of this program can be calculated by analyzing the memory usage at each step. Initially, we allocate memory for the array of size `n * sizeof(int)`, which takes up `n * 4` bytes of memory (assuming an integer takes up 4 bytes). Then, we use a `for` loop to input each element of the array one by one, which takes up `4` bytes of memory per integer. Finally, we print the array elements, which does not require any additional memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "After printing the array elements, we free the memory allocated for the array using the `free()` function. This is important to avoid memory leaks, which occur when memory is allocated but not freed, leading to a gradual increase in memory usage over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, managing memory efficiently is an important aspect of programming in C. By carefully allocating and freeing memory, we can avoid memory leaks and runtime errors and ensure that our programs run smoothly."

    "Problem: Implement a C program that reads in a large text file and counts the frequency of each word in the file. Your program should output the top 10 most frequent words and their corresponding counts. However, your program should also have a memory limit of 1 GB.\n",

    "The program should be able to handle text files up to 10 GB in size, so it is important to optimize the memory usage of your program. You should also consider using data structures that are efficient for searching and sorting.\n",

The students will need to consider data structures that can handle large amounts of data while minimizing memory usage, such as hash tables, tries, and binary search trees.
