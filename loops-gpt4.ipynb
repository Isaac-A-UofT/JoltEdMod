    "# For Loops in Python: A Beginner's Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're working in a factory, and your job is to inspect and label a series of items coming down a conveyor belt. For each item that passes by, you need to perform the same set of actions: examine the item, put a label on it, and then send it on its way. As a beginner programmer, this is similar to what a `for` loop does in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Metaphor\n",
    "\n",
    "In this metaphor, the conveyor belt represents a sequence of items, such as a list, a tuple, or a range of numbers. The actions you perform on each item represent the code block inside the loop. Lastly, the repetition of these actions for each item in the sequence represents the loop itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop in Python can be thought of as a way to automate repetitive tasks, like inspecting and labeling items in the factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a `for` loop is written using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed for each item in the sequence\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `variable` is a temporary name given to each item in the `sequence` as the loop iterates through it, and the `code block` contains the instructions that should be executed for each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples to better understand how `for` loops work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Looping through a list\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a list of items that need to be inspected and labeled. In Python, we can create a list like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's use a `for` loop to inspect and label each item in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in items:\n",
    "    print(f\"Inspecting {item}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Labeling {item}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Inspecting apple\n",
    "Labeling apple\n",
    "Inspecting banana\n",
    "Labeling banana\n",
    "Inspecting orange\n",
    "Labeling orange\n",
    "Inspecting grape\n",
    "Labeling grape\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Looping through a range of numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, let's say you need to label a series of items with numbers from 1 to 10. You can use the `range()` function to create a sequence of numbers and a `for` loop to iterate through it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for number in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    print(f\"Labeling item with number {number}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Labeling item with number 1\n",
    "Labeling item with number 2\n",
    "Labeling item with number 3\n",
    "...\n",
    "Labeling item with number 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a `for` loop in Python is a powerful tool that allows you to automate repetitive tasks by iterating through a sequence of items and executing a code block for each item. By understanding this metaphor and practicing with examples, you'll be well on your way to becoming proficient in using `for` loops in your Python programs."

    "# For Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, for loops are used for iterating over a sequence (that can be a list, tuple, string, etc.). With for loops, you can execute a block of code once for each item in the sequence. This allows you to perform tasks on each item in an efficient and readable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example in which we want to print each element of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Printing Elements of a List\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# List of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterating over the list using a for loop\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we first create a list called `numbers` containing integers from 1 to 5. Then, we use a for loop to iterate over each element in the list. The `for num in numbers:` line specifies that we want to iterate over the `numbers` list and, at each iteration, store the current element in the variable `num`. Inside the for loop, we have a block of code (indented by 4 spaces) that gets executed once for each element in the list. In this case, we simply print the current element stored in the `num` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the above code is executed, it will produce the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider another example where we want to calculate the sum of all elements in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Calculating the Sum of Elements in a List\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# List of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize a variable to store the sum\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterating over the list using a for loop\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    # Add the current number to the total\n",
    "    total += num\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the final sum\n",
    "print(\"The sum of all numbers in the list is:\", total)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we first create a list called `numbers` containing integers from 1 to 5. We also initialize a variable called `total` with the value 0, which will be used to store the sum of the elements in the list. Then, we use a for loop to iterate over each element in the list. Inside the for loop, we add the current element stored in the `num` variable to the `total` variable using the `+=` operator. Finally, after the for loop has iterated over all elements in the list, we print the final sum stored in the `total` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the above code is executed, it will produce the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The sum of all numbers in the list is: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples should give you an idea of how for loops in Python can be used to perform tasks on each element of a sequence. As you progress in your programming journey, you'll find various use cases for for loops, which will help you write efficient and readable code."

    "Problem: Write a Python program using a for loop to count the number of even numbers between 1 and a given number n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description:\n",
    "In this problem, you are required to write a Python program that will take an integer input (n) and print the number of even numbers between 1 and n using a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the input is 10, the output should be 5, as there are five even numbers between 1 and 10 (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Take an integer input n from the user.\n",
    "2. Initialize a variable called 'count' to store the number of even numbers.\n",
    "3. Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers between 1 and n (inclusive).\n",
    "4. Inside the loop, use an if statement to check if the current number is even.\n",
    "5. If the number is even, increment the count variable by 1.\n",
    "6. After the loop, print the value of the count variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "- To get an integer input from the user, you can use the following code: `n = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))`.\n",
    "- To check if a number is even, you can use the modulo operator (%). If a number's remainder when divided by 2 is 0, it is even: `number % 2 == 0`."
