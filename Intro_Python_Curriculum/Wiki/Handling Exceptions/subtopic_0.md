Hello class, today we will be discussing exception handling basics. Exception handling is like having a safety net when you're walking on a tightrope. Just like a tightrope walker can fall off the rope, our programs can also encounter errors and crash. But just as a safety net can catch a tightrope walker and prevent them from falling to the ground, exception handling can catch errors in our program and prevent it from crashing.


Think of it this way: when we write a program, we're essentially walking on a tightrope. We have to balance different variables and functions to make sure our program runs smoothly. But sometimes, unexpected things happen, just like a gust of wind can throw a tightrope walker off balance. When this happens, our program encounters an error and crashes.


This is where exception handling comes in. It's like having a safety net underneath us as we walk on the tightrope. If we fall off, the safety net catches us and we can get back up and try again. Similarly, if our program encounters an error, the exception handling mechanism catches the error and allows our program to continue running without crashing.


So, in short, exception handling is a safety mechanism that catches errors in our program and prevents it from crashing. It's like a safety net for a tightrope walker, allowing us to keep moving forward even if we encounter unexpected obstacles.


Exception Handling Basics
=========================


Introduction
------------


Exception handling is an important concept in programming that enables the programmer to handle errors that may occur during program execution. These errors are called exceptions and can be caused by a variety of factors such as user input errors, incorrect logic, or system errors. In this lecture, we will discuss the basics of exception handling in Python.


The try-except block
--------------------


The try-except block is used to handle exceptions in Python. The basic syntax of a try-except block is as follows:


`python
try:
 # Code that may cause an exception
except ExceptionType:
 # Code to handle the exception`


The code inside the try block is the code that may cause an exception. The code inside the except block is the code that will be executed if an exception of the specified type is raised.


Example
-------


Let's consider the following example:


```python


Division function
=================


def divide(x, y):
 try:
 result = x / y
 print(f"The result is {result}")
 except ZeroDivisionError:
 print("Cannot divide by zero")
```


Here, we have a function named `divide` that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and tries to divide `x` by `y`. If `y` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` exception is raised.


Let's see how we can use this function:


```python


Test the function
=================


divide(8, 2) # Output: The result is 4.0
divide(8, 0) # Output: Cannot divide by zero
```


In the first call to the `divide` function, we pass `8` and `2` as arguments, and the function successfully divides `8` by `2`, resulting in a value of `4.0`.


In the second call to the `divide` function, we pass `8` and `0` as arguments, and since we cannot divide by zero, the function raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception. However, since we have a try-except block in place, the exception is caught and the code inside the except block is executed, resulting in the output `Cannot divide by zero`.


Conclusion
----------


In conclusion, exception handling is an essential concept in programming that allows us to handle errors that may occur during program execution. Python provides a try-except block that enables us to catch and handle exceptions in our code.


Exception Handling Basics in Python
===================================


As you start writing code, you may come across situations where your program fails to execute properly due to various reasons such as invalid user input, network failure, file not found, syntax errors, and so on. Such situations are called exceptions in Python.


Python provides a mechanism to handle such exceptions so that your program does not crash and burn. This mechanism is called **exception handling**.


Example Use Cases
-----------------


Let's consider three example use cases to understand how exception handling works.


### 1. Division by Zero


Suppose you want to write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and divides them. However, you realize that if the user enters 0 as the second input, your program will crash since division by zero is an invalid operation. To handle this situation, you can use the `try-except` block in Python.


`python
try:
 num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
 num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
 result = num1 / num2
 print("The result is:", result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
 print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")`


In this code, we try to execute the division operation in the `try` block. If the division operation fails due to a `ZeroDivisionError`, the code in the `except` block is executed, which prints an error message.


### 2. File Not Found


Suppose you want to write a program that reads data from a file and performs some operations on it. However, you realize that the file may not exist or may be inaccessible due to permission issues. To handle this situation, you can use the `try-except` block in Python.


`python
try:
 with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
 data = f.read()
 print("The contents of the file are:", data)
except FileNotFoundError:
 print("Error: The file 'data.txt' does not exist.")
except PermissionError:
 print("Error: You do not have permission to access the file 'data.txt'.")`


In this code, we try to open the file in the `try` block and read its contents. If the file does not exist or is inaccessible due to permission issues, the code in the respective `except` blocks is executed, which prints an error message.


### 3. Invalid User Input


Suppose you want to write a program that takes an integer as input from the user and performs some operations on it. However, you realize that the user may enter an invalid input such as a string or a decimal number. To handle this situation, you can use the `try-except` block in Python.


`python
try:
 num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
 print("The input is:", num)
except ValueError:
 print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")`


In this code, we try to convert the user input to an integer in the `try` block. If the user input is not a valid integer, the code in the `except` block is executed, which prints an error message.


Conclusion
----------


In summary, exception handling is a mechanism in Python that allows you to handle situations where your program may fail due to various reasons such as invalid user input, network failure, file not found, syntax errors, and so on. By using the `try-except` block, you can gracefully handle such situations and prevent your program from crashing.
