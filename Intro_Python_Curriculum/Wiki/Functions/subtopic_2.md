Scope and Lifetime of Variables
-------------------------------


Variables are an essential part of programming. Think of them as containers that hold information. Just like we have different types of containers, we also have different types of variables. However, the two most important aspects of variables are their scope and lifetime.


### Scope


The scope of a variable determines where the variable can be accessed in a program. The scope of a variable can be thought of as the visibility of the variable. 


Imagine you have a bookshelf in your room. You can see and access the books on that bookshelf because they are within your reach. However, you cannot see or access the books on the bookshelf in your neighbor's room because they are outside your reach.


Similarly, the scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed in a program. A variable with a global scope can be accessed from anywhere in the program, just like the books on your bookshelf. A variable with a local scope, on the other hand, can only be accessed within the block of code where it is declared, just like the books on your neighbor's bookshelf.


### Lifetime


The lifetime of a variable determines how long the variable exists in a program. 


Imagine you have a plant in your room. The plant has a lifespan, and it will eventually die. However, during its lifetime, it can grow, flower, and bear fruit. 


Similarly, the lifetime of a variable determines how long it exists in a program. A variable with a global lifetime exists throughout the entire program, from beginning to end. A variable with a local lifetime, on the other hand, only exists for the duration of the block of code where it is declared.


In conclusion, understanding the scope and lifetime of variables is crucial for writing effective programs. Just like you need to know where your books are and how long your plant will live, you need to know where your variables can be accessed and how long they will exist in your program.


Scope and Lifetime of Variables
===============================


As we write programs, we often create variables to store and manipulate data. It's important to understand the concept of scope and lifetime of variables to ensure that our programs run efficiently and correctly.


Scope
-----


The scope of a variable refers to the part of the program where the variable can be accessed. In other words, it's the region of the program where the variable is defined and can be used.


There are three main types of scope:


1. **Global Scope**: A variable with global scope can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including inside functions and loops.
2. **Local Scope**: A variable with local scope can only be accessed from within the block of code where it was defined. This includes functions and loops.
3. **Function Scope**: A variable with function scope can only be accessed from within the function where it was defined.


Lifetime
--------


The lifetime of a variable refers to the amount of time that the variable exists in memory. In other words, it's the duration of time during which the variable can be accessed.


There are two main types of lifetime:


1. **Static Lifetime**: A variable with static lifetime exists for the entire duration of the program. This means that the variable is created when the program starts and is destroyed when the program ends.
2. **Dynamic Lifetime**: A variable with dynamic lifetime exists only for a specific duration of time during the program's execution. This means that the variable is created when it is needed and is destroyed when it is no longer needed.


Example
-------


Let's take a look at an example to illustrate the concept of scope and lifetime of variables.


```python


Global scope
============


global\_var = 10


def my*function():
 # Function scope
 local*var = 20
 print("local*var inside function:", local*var)



```
global global_var
global_var = 30
print("global_var inside function:", global_var)

```

my\_function()


print("global*var outside function:", global*var)
```


In this example, we have a variable called `global_var` with global scope that is defined outside of any functions. We also have a function called `my_function` that defines a variable called `local_var` with function scope.


When we call `my_function`, it prints the value of `local_var` inside the function, which is 20. It then changes the value of `global_var` to 30 and prints the value of `global_var` inside the function, which is also 30.


After the function call, we then print the value of `global_var` outside of the function, which is now 30 due to the change made inside the function.


Notice that we cannot access `local_var` outside of the function because it has local scope. Similarly, if we defined another variable inside a loop, we would only be able to access that variable inside the loop because it also has local scope.


That's it for today's lesson on scope and lifetime of variables. Keep these concepts in mind as you continue to write programs, and you'll be well on your way to becoming a proficient programmer!


Scope and Lifetime of Variables
===============================


As we write code, we often use variables to store data and manipulate it. However, it's important to understand two concepts that govern how variables work: scope and lifetime.


Scope
-----


The scope of a variable refers to where in the code it can be accessed. There are two types of scope: local and global.


### Local Scope


When a variable is defined within a function, it has local scope. This means that it can only be accessed within that function. Once the function ends, the variable is destroyed and cannot be accessed from outside the function.


For example:


```python
def my\_function():
 x = 5
 print(x)


my\_function() # Output: 5
print(x) # Error: x is not defined
```


In this example, `x` is only defined within `my_function`. It cannot be accessed from outside the function.


### Global Scope


When a variable is defined outside of a function, it has global scope. This means that it can be accessed from anywhere in the code, including within functions.


For example:


```python
x = 5


def my\_function():
 print(x)


my\_function() # Output: 5
print(x) # Output: 5
```


In this example, `x` is defined outside of `my_function`, so it has global scope. It can be accessed from within the function as well as from outside the function.


Lifetime
--------


The lifetime of a variable refers to how long it exists in memory. There are two types of lifetime: temporary and persistent.


### Temporary Lifetime


When a variable is defined within a function, it has temporary lifetime. This means that it only exists as long as the function is running. Once the function ends, the variable is destroyed and its value is lost.


For example:


```python
def my\_function():
 x = 5
 print(x)


my\_function() # Output: 5
print(x) # Error: x is not defined
```


In this example, `x` is only defined within `my_function`. Once the function ends, `x` is destroyed and its value is lost.


### Persistent Lifetime


When a variable is defined outside of a function, it has persistent lifetime. This means that it exists for as long as the program is running, or until it is explicitly destroyed.


For example:


```python
x = 5


while True:
 print(x)
```


In this example, `x` is defined outside of the `while` loop, so it has persistent lifetime. It will continue to exist and retain its value as long as the program is running.
