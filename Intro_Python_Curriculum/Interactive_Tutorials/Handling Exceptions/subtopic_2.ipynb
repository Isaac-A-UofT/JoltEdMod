    "Good day class, today we will be discussing raising exceptions in programming. In simple terms, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. Think of it as a problem that arises when the program tries to do something it's not supposed to do or when it cannot do something it's supposed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine you are a waiter in a restaurant. Your job is to take orders from the customers, relay the orders to the kitchen, and serve the food to the customers. However, sometimes things may go wrong. For example, the kitchen may be out of a particular dish, or a customer may have an allergy to a certain ingredient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these situations, you would need to raise an exception to inform the customer and the kitchen that there is a problem. You may say something like, \"I'm sorry, we are out of that dish at the moment,\" or \"I apologize, but we cannot fulfill that request due to allergy concerns.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in programming, when a problem arises, the program needs to raise an exception to inform the user that something went wrong. This helps the user understand the problem and allows the program to handle the error properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, raising exceptions is a way for programs to inform users of errors that occur during execution. It's like a waiter informing a customer and the kitchen of a problem that arises during a meal service."

    "# Raising Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, exceptions are raised when something unexpected happens during the execution of a program. An exception is a signal that indicates that an error has occurred and that the program cannot continue normally. It is important to handle exceptions properly to make sure that your program does not crash unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception can be raised manually using the `raise` statement. This is useful when you want to signal that something unexpected has happened in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we are building a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. If the width or height of the rectangle is negative, we want to raise an exception to signal that the input is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def rectangle_area(width, height):\n",
    "    if width < 0 or height < 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Width and height must be positive\")\n",
    "    return width * height\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are using the `raise` statement to raise a `ValueError` exception if the width or height of the rectangle is negative. The `ValueError` exception is a built-in exception in Python that is raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but inappropriate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a `try`...`except` block to catch and handle the exception. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    area = rectangle_area(-5, 10)\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are calling the `rectangle_area` function with a negative width, which will raise a `ValueError` exception. We catch the exception using a `try`...`except` block and print the error message using the `print` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to handle exceptions properly in your code to make sure that your program does not crash unexpectedly. When raising exceptions, you should provide a descriptive error message that helps the user understand what went wrong and how to fix it."

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this program, we define a custom exception class \"DivisionByZeroError\" which is raised if the second input number is zero. We use a try-except block to catch this exception and display an error message. Otherwise, we calculate the quotient and remainder and display the results. This problem teaches students about raising and handling exceptions in Python, as well as the concept of division by zero."
