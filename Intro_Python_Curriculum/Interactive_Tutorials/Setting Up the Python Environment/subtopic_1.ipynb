    "Welcome to our discussion on Python IDEs and editors. Before we dive into the specifics, let's start with a metaphor that might help you understand the difference between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of IDEs as a complete kitchen with all the equipment you need to cook a meal, like an oven, stove, refrigerator, and all the utensils. An IDE is similar in that it provides you with all the tools you need to write, run, and debug your code in one place. It includes a code editor, a debugger, a compiler, and other features that help you develop your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, think of editors as a single kitchen tool, like a chef's knife. An editor is similar in that it's a tool that helps you write your code. It's a lightweight tool that's designed to be fast and efficient, and it's often used by developers who prefer simplicity and speed over the added features of an IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, which one is better? It really depends on what you're trying to accomplish. If you're working on a large project with many files and complex code, an IDE might be the way to go. It provides you with all the necessary tools to manage your project, from code completion and syntax highlighting to debugging and profiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you're working on a small project or just need to quickly edit a file, an editor might be a better choice. It's lightweight, fast, and easy to use, and it's perfect for simple tasks like editing a configuration file or tweaking a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, both IDEs and editors have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on your specific needs and preferences. I hope this metaphor has helped you understand the difference between the two, and I encourage you to experiment with different IDEs and editors to find the one that works best for you."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this section, we will be discussing Python IDEs and editors. As a computer science student, it is important to have a good understanding of the different IDEs and editors available for Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "# What are IDEs and editors?\n",
    "IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, while editors are simply text editors that allow you to write code. IDEs are more advanced than editors, typically providing features like code completion, debugging, and version control. Editors, on the other hand, are simpler and usually just provide basic text editing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples of Python IDEs\n",
    "There are several Python IDEs available, including PyCharm, Spyder, and IDLE. In this example, we will be using PyCharm.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Code\n",
    "Let's take a look at a simple Python program using PyCharm as our IDE:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import the math module\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a function to calculate the area of a circle\n",
    "def calculate_area(radius):\n",
    "    return math.pi * radius ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prompt the user for the radius of the circle\n",
    "radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate and print the area of the circle\n",
    "area = calculate_area(radius)\n",
    "print(\"The area of the circle is: \", area)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we have imported the math module and defined a function to calculate the area of a circle. We then prompt the user for the radius of the circle, calculate the area using our function, and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Features of PyCharm\n",
    "PyCharm provides several features that make writing and debugging Python code easier. For example, PyCharm provides code completion, which suggests possible code completions as you type. It also provides a debugger, which allows you to step through your code line by line and see the values of variables at each step. Additionally, PyCharm provides version control integration, allowing you to easily manage your code with Git, SVN, and other version control systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion, Python IDEs and editors provide a powerful toolset for developing Python applications. As a computer science student, it is important to have a good understanding of the different IDEs and editors available, as well as their features and capabilities. PyCharm is just one example of a powerful Python IDE that can make your coding experience easier and more efficient."

    "Write a Python program that reads a text file containing the names and marks of students in a class. The program should calculate the average marks and print the names of students who scored higher than the average. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should be designed to be run in either an IDE or an editor of your choice. Make sure to include comments in your code to explain what each part of the program does. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you should explain to the students how to use the IDE or editor to run the program. For example, you may explain how to create a new Python file, how to save the file, how to run the program, and how to view the output. You may also demonstrate how to debug the program if it encounters errors."

    "    assert True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    assert False\n",
    "```\n",

    "These tests should give you a good starting point to check if your methods are working correctly. You can modify them as needed to fit your specific implementation."
