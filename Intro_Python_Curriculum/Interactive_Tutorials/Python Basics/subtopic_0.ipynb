    "Welcome, first-year computer science students! Today we will be discussing Python syntax. Think of Python as a language, just like English or Spanish. Just like in English, we have rules for how we construct sentences and paragraphs, Python also has its own set of rules for how we construct code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's dive into some metaphors to help us understand Python syntax. Think of Python as a recipe book. Just like a recipe book has a set of instructions for how to make a dish, Python has a set of instructions for how to execute a task. In Python, these instructions are called statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each statement is like a step in a recipe. Just like how we have ingredients in a recipe, Python has variables. Variables hold values, just like how ingredients hold flavor or texture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say we want to make a cake. We have a list of ingredients and instructions on how to mix them together. But what happens if we accidentally forget to add sugar to the mix? The cake won't turn out as expected. Similarly, in Python, if we forget to add a colon at the end of a statement or misspell a variable name, our code won't work as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's talk about indentation. Just like how we need to follow a recipe and mix ingredients in a specific order, Python requires us to follow a certain structure. We use indentation to show which statements are grouped together. Think of it like a paragraph in English. We indent the first line to indicate the beginning of a new thought or idea. In Python, we use indentation to indicate the beginning of a new block of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this metaphor helps you understand Python syntax better. Remember, just like how we can learn a new language, we can learn Python syntax too!"

    "# Introduction to Python Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in various industries. It is known for its simplicity and readability, making it an ideal choice for beginners. In this chapter, we will explore the basic syntax of Python using a code example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hello World!\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, the \"Hello World!\" program is often used as a starting point to learn a new language. It is a simple program that prints the phrase \"Hello World!\" to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can use the `print()` function to output text to the screen. Let's take a look at the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment\n",
    "print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line is a comment. Comments are used to explain what the code does and are ignored by the computer when the program is run. In Python, comments start with the `#` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line is the `print()` function. The `print()` function takes a string as an argument and outputs it to the screen. In this case, the string is \"Hello World!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this code, we can save it in a file with a `.py` extension and execute it using the Python interpreter. Alternatively, we can use a Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as PyCharm or Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are used to store data in a program. In Python, we can declare a variable by simply assigning a value to it. Let's take a look at the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment\n",
    "message = \"Hello World!\"\n",
    "print(message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line is a comment, which explains what the code does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line declares a variable called `message` and assigns it the value \"Hello World!\". Note that we don't have to declare the type of the variable in Python, as it is dynamically typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third line uses the `print()` function to output the value of the `message` variable to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports various data types, including strings, integers, floats, and booleans. Let's take a look at the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment\n",
    "name = \"John\"  # String\n",
    "age = 25  # Integer\n",
    "height = 1.75  # Float\n",
    "is_student = True  # Boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "print(name)\n",
    "print(age)\n",
    "print(height)\n",
    "print(is_student)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line is a comment, which explains what the code does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next four lines declare variables of different data types. `name` is a string, `age` is an integer, `height` is a float, and `is_student` is a boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last four lines use the `print()` function to output the values of the variables to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we have explored the basic syntax of Python using a code example. We have covered how to output text to the screen using the `print()` function, how to declare variables, and the different data types that Python supports. With this knowledge, you can start writing your own Python programs!"

    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Ask the user to input the length and width of a rectangle.\n",
    "2. Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.\n",
    "3. Print the calculated values in a user-friendly format.\n",
