    "Welcome, first year computer science students! Today we are going to learn about file modes, which are an important concept in computer science. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of file modes as a set of instructions that we give to a computer when we want to work with a file. Just like how we give directions to a person to follow, we give file modes to the computer to follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's imagine that you are a chef, and you have a recipe book. The recipe book is like a file, and the file modes are like the instructions you give to the computer when you want to work with the recipe book. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to read a recipe from the book, you would use the \"read\" file mode. If you want to add a new recipe to the book, you would use the \"write\" file mode. And if you want to edit a recipe in the book, you would use the \"append\" file mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, just like in cooking, there are different ways to use the same recipe. You can follow the instructions exactly, or you can add your own twist to make it unique. Similarly, there are different combinations of file modes that you can use to work with a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, to sum it up, file modes are like instructions that we give to a computer when we want to work with a file, and just like in cooking, there are different ways to use the same recipe. I hope you found this metaphor helpful, and that you now have a better understanding of file modes."

    "# Understanding File Modes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first year computer science student, you will frequently work with files in Python. One important concept to understand is file modes, which specify how the file will be opened and used. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are several file modes that can be used when opening files. These modes determine whether you can read from, write to, or append to the file. The modes are specified as strings when the `open()` function is called. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use file modes in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open a file in write mode\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write some text to the file\n",
    "file.write(\"This is an example file.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the file in read mode\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read the contents of the file\n",
    "contents = file.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the contents of the file\n",
    "print(contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we first open a file called \"example.txt\" in write mode (`\"w\"`). We then write some text to the file using the `write()` function. After we are done writing, we close the file using the `close()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we open the same file in read mode (`\"r\"`) and read the contents of the file using the `read()` function. Finally, we print the contents of the file and close the file using the `close()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that when opening a file in write mode, any existing contents of the file will be overwritten. If you want to append to an existing file instead of overwriting it, you can open the file in append mode (`\"a\"`) instead of write mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, file modes in Python determine how the file will be opened and used. By understanding the different modes and how they work, you can effectively read from and write to files in your Python programs."

    "Problem:\n",

    "Create a program that allows users to create a new file and set its file mode. The program should prompt the user for the file name and the file mode, and create the file with the specified mode. The program should then display the file mode of the newly created file.\n",

    "Requirements:\n",
    "- The program should check if the file already exists before creating it.\n",
    "- The program should only accept valid file modes (e.g. 644, 755, etc.).\n",
    "- The program should handle errors gracefully (e.g. invalid file name, invalid file mode, file already exists, etc.).\n",
    "- The program should be written in a programming language of your choice.\n",
