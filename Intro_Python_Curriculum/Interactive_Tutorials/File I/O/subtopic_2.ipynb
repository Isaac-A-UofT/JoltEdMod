    "Hello first year computer science students! Today we will be discussing a very important topic, \"Working with Directories\". In simple terms, directories are like folders that contain files. Just like how you organize your school books in different folders, directories help organize the files on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give you an example to help you understand better. Imagine your computer is like a library and the directories are the different sections of the library. Just like how books on history are kept in the history section, files related to a particular topic are kept in a specific directory. This helps you to easily find the file you are looking for without having to search through the entire computer just like how you can easily find a book on a particular topic if you know which section it is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's talk about some basic operations that you can perform on directories. Just like how you can create a new folder to organize your books, you can create a new directory to organize your files. You can also rename a directory just like how you can rename a folder on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on, just like how you can move a book from one folder to another, you can move a file from one directory to another. You can also delete a directory just like how you can delete a folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, directories are an important tool that helps you to organize your files on your computer just like how you organize your books in folders. By understanding how to work with directories, you can easily find the file you are looking for and keep your computer organized."

    "# Working with Directories in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a directory (also known as a folder) is a container for files and other directories. Directories are used to organize files and make it easier to locate and access them. In Python, the `os` module provides functions for working with directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new directory in Python, we can use the `os.mkdir()` function. This function takes a single argument, which is the name of the directory we want to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new directory called \"mydir\"\n",
    "os.mkdir(\"mydir\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changing the Current Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the current directory in Python, we can use the `os.chdir()` function. This function takes a single argument, which is the path to the directory we want to change to.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Change the current directory to \"mydir\"\n",
    "os.chdir(\"mydir\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Listing the Contents of a Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "To list the contents of a directory in Python, we can use the `os.listdir()` function. This function takes a single argument, which is the path to the directory we want to list the contents of.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# List the contents of the current directory\n",
    "print(os.listdir(\".\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will print a list of all the files and directories in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Removing a Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove a directory in Python, we can use the `os.rmdir()` function. This function takes a single argument, which is the name of the directory we want to remove.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove the directory called \"mydir\"\n",
    "os.rmdir(\"mydir\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have learned how to create, change, list, and remove directories in Python using the `os` module. Directories are an important part of organizing files and data, and being able to work with them in Python is a valuable skill for any computer scientist."

The program should also display appropriate error messages if the operation cannot be performed (e.g. if a file to be deleted does not exist).\n",
