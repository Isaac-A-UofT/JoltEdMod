    "Welcome to the history lesson of one of the most popular programming languages, Python. Let's start by imagining that programming languages are like different languages spoken around the world. Just like how we have English, French, Spanish, Chinese, and many more, there are different programming languages, each with its own unique characteristics and uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, in this context, is like a language that is easy to learn and understand. It's like learning a language that uses simple grammar and has a straightforward structure. Just like how you can express your thoughts and ideas more easily if you know a language that is easy to use, programming in Python is easier because of its simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was created in the late 1980s by a Dutch programmer named Guido van Rossum. He wanted to create a language that was easy to read and write, and that's how Python was born. Python was named after a British comedy group, Monty Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, Python has evolved and grown in popularity. It's used in a wide range of applications, from web development to data science and artificial intelligence. Just like how a language can help you communicate your ideas to others, Python helps programmers communicate their instructions to computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Python is like a language that is simple to learn, easy to use, and has a wide range of applications. It's no wonder that it has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world."

    "# Python History\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first class of Introduction to Computer Science! Today, we are going to discuss the history of Python programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and was first released in 1991. The language was named after Monty Python, a British comedy group, and not the reptile, as some people may think.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn and use. It has a simple syntax, which means that the code is easy to read and write. It is also a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the history of Python, let's look at a simple example. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment in Python\n",
    "# This program prints \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are using Python to print the message \"Hello, World!\" to the screen. The `print()` function is a built-in function in Python that allows us to display text on the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "This program may seem simple, but it is an essential part of the history of programming languages. The \"Hello, World!\" program has been used as a test program for many programming languages since the 1970s. It is an easy way to test if the language is installed correctly, and it is a good way to introduce beginners to programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Python is a powerful programming language that has a rich history. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and was first released in 1991. Python's simplicity and versatility have made it one of the most popular programming languages in the world."

The third test removes the remaining items and checks that the length is 0."
