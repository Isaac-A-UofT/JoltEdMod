    "# Function Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a function is a set of instructions that performs a specific task. Functions can take inputs, called arguments, which allows them to be more flexible and reusable. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at an example of a function that takes two arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_numbers(num1, num2):\n",
    "    result = num1 + num2\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is called `add_numbers` and takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`. The function adds the two numbers together and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this function by calling it and passing in two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = add_numbers(2, 3)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are passing in `2` and `3` as arguments to the `add_numbers` function. The function adds the two numbers together and returns `5`. We then assign the result to a variable called `result` and print it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Positional Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, arguments can be passed to a function in two different ways: positional arguments and keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional arguments are the most common type of arguments. They are passed in the order that they are defined in the function. In our example, `num1` is the first argument and `num2` is the second argument. When we call the function, we pass in the arguments in the same order:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = add_numbers(2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `2` is assigned to `num1` and `3` is assigned to `num2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keyword Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyword arguments are passed to a function using the argument name. This allows us to pass arguments in any order, as long as we specify the argument name. Let's modify our `add_numbers` function to take keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_numbers(num1=0, num2=0):\n",
    "    result = num1 + num2\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this modified version of the function, we have set default values for `num1` and `num2` to be `0`. This means that if we don't pass in any arguments, the function will still work and return `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now call the function using keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = add_numbers(num2=3, num1=2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are passing in `2` as `num1` and `3` as `num2`, but we're doing it in a different order than we did before. By specifying the argument names, we can pass in the arguments in any order we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Function arguments are an important part of writing flexible and reusable code. By allowing functions to take inputs, we can write functions that can be used in a variety of contexts. Positional arguments are the most common type of arguments, but keyword arguments can also be useful when we want to pass arguments in a different order or when we want to set default values."
