    "Dear first year computer science students,\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will be discussing the concept of defining functions. Think of a function as a recipe for a cake. Just like a recipe, a function takes a set of inputs, performs some operations on them, and produces an output. Just as a recipe has a set of instructions for baking a cake, a function has a set of instructions for performing some operation on the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine you have a recipe for a cake that you want to use several times. You wouldn't want to rewrite the entire recipe every time you want to bake a cake, right? That would be time-consuming and tedious. Instead, you would define the recipe once and then reuse it whenever you need it. Similarly, defining a function allows us to reuse a set of instructions over and over again without having to rewrite the code every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of defining functions is that it makes our code more organized and easier to read. Just as a recipe has different steps and ingredients, a function can have different parts that perform specific tasks. This makes it easier to understand what the function does and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, defining a function is like creating a recipe for a cake. It allows us to reuse a set of instructions without having to rewrite them every time, and it makes our code more organized and easier to read."

    "## Defining Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are fundamental building blocks of any programming language and are used to encapsulate a set of instructions. They are essentially reusable pieces of code, which makes programming more efficient and less error-prone. In Python, functions are defined using the \"def\" keyword followed by the name of the function and parentheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a simple function that takes in two integers and returns their sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_numbers(x, y):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function takes in two numbers and returns their sum.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of the function definition starts with the \"def\" keyword, followed by the name of the function. In this case, the name of the function is \"add_numbers\". The parentheses following the function name indicate that this function takes two arguments, x and y. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second line of this function definition is a docstring, which is a string that provides documentation about the function. The docstring is enclosed in triple quotes. It is good practice to include a docstring for every function you define, as it helps other programmers understand what the function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third line of this function definition is the actual code that performs the addition of x and y. The \"return\" keyword is used to return the result of the addition operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a function is defined, it can be called using its name and passing in the necessary arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = add_numbers(3, 5)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will output the result of adding 3 and 5, which is 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can also have default values for their arguments. For example, let's modify the \"add_numbers\" function to have a default value of 0 for the second argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_numbers(x, y=0):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function takes in two numbers and returns their sum.\n",
    "    If only one number is provided, it returns that number.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this modification, the \"add_numbers\" function can be called with only one argument, and it will return that argument. If two arguments are provided, it will return their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result1 = add_numbers(3)\n",
    "result2 = add_numbers(3, 5)\n",
    "print(result1)\n",
    "print(result2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will output 3 and 8, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, functions are a powerful tool in Python that allow you to encapsulate a set of instructions and reuse them as needed. They make programming more efficient and less error-prone."
