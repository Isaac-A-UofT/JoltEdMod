    "Hello, first-year computer science students! Today we're going to talk about importing modules. You can think of a module as a toolbox. Each toolbox contains a set of tools that you can use to solve a specific problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you're working on a project, you might need to use a lot of different tools. Just like how you wouldn't want to carry around a bunch of heavy tools in your backpack, you also don't want to keep all the tools you might need directly in your code. That's where importing modules comes in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing a module is like borrowing a toolbox from the library. You can use the tools inside the toolbox to solve your problem, but you don't have to carry around all the tools with you all the time. Once you're done using the tools, you return the toolbox to the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, when you import a module, you can use the functions and classes inside the module to solve your problem, but you don't have to write all the code for those functions and classes yourself. Once you're done using them, you simply stop using the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, importing modules is a way to make your code more efficient and organized. It allows you to reuse code that someone else has already written, rather than writing it all yourself. Plus, it helps keep your code clean and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this metaphor helps you understand the concept of importing modules. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!"

    "# Importing Modules in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a module is a way of organizing code. A module can define functions, classes, and variables that can be used in other parts of a program. Python comes with many built-in modules, such as `math`, `random`, and `datetime`. There are also many third-party modules that can be installed and used in Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax for Importing Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a module in a Python program, it must first be imported. The `import` statement is used to do this. Here's the basic syntax for importing a module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to import the `math` module, the following code would be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a module has been imported, its functions, classes, and variables can be accessed using the dot notation. For example, to use the `sqrt` function from the `math` module to calculate the square root of 2, we would do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "x = math.sqrt(2)\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would output `1.4142135623730951`, which is the square root of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aliasing Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, module names can be long or difficult to remember. In such cases, it can be useful to give a module a shorter alias. This is done using the `as` keyword. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math as m\n",
    "\n",
    "x = m.sqrt(2)\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is equivalent to the previous example, but the `math` module has been given the shorter alias `m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Specific Functions or Variables from a Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it may be only necessary to use specific functions or variables from a module. This can be done using the `from` keyword. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from math import sqrt\n",
    "\n",
    "x = sqrt(2)\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code imports only the `sqrt` function from the `math` module, which can then be used directly without the need for the `math.` prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, importing modules is a fundamental concept in Python programming. By importing modules, we can organize our code and use functions, classes, and variables from other parts of our program or from external third-party modules. The basic syntax for importing modules is simple, and there are additional techniques such as aliasing and importing specific functions or variables that can make our code more concise and readable."

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "To import a module into your main program, you can use the `import` keyword followed by the name of the module you want to import. Once you have imported the module, you can use any functions or variables defined in that module by using the dot notation, e.g. `module_name.function_name()`.\n",

    "```python\n",

    "grades.add_grade(85)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code imports the `grades` module and calls the `add_grade()` function, passing in the grade value of 85.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create some empty methods with comments for what they should do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# grades.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def add_grade(grade):\n",
    "    # This method should add a grade to a list of grades\n",
    "    \n",
    "def calculate_average(grades):\n",

    "    \n",
    "def get_letter_grade(average_grade):\n",
    "    # This method should return the letter grade based on the average grade\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's create 3 assertion tests to ensure that the methods are implemented correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# test_grades.py\n",
    "\n",
    "import grades\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_add_grade():\n",
    "    grades.add_grade(85)\n",
    "    assert grades.grades == [85]\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_calculate_average():\n",
    "    grades.add_grade(85)\n",
    "    grades.add_grade(90)\n",
    "    grades.add_grade(95)\n",
    "    assert grades.calculate_average(grades.grades) == 90\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_get_letter_grade():\n",
    "    assert grades.get_letter_grade(85) == 'B'\n",
    "    assert grades.get_letter_grade(90) == 'A'\n",
    "    assert grades.get_letter_grade(75) == 'C'\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "These assertion tests will help ensure that the `add_grade()`, `calculate_average()`, and `get_letter_grade()` methods are functioning correctly."
