    "# Understanding Polymorphism \n",
    "\n",
    "Hello everyone! Today, we are going to talk about Polymorphism. Polymorphism is a fancy word that we use in computer science to describe a very simple concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain Polymorphism, let me give you a simple metaphor. Imagine you have a pet dog at home. Your dog's name is Max, and he is a Golden Retriever. Max is a very friendly and obedient dog, and he loves to play fetch with you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine that you go to your friend's house, and they also have a pet dog. Your friend's dog's name is Buddy, and he is a Labrador Retriever. Buddy is also a very friendly and obedient dog, and he loves to play fetch with your friend. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Max and Buddy are different dogs, they share some common traits. For example, they both have four legs, a tail, and they both love to play fetch. This is similar to how Polymorphism works in computer science. \n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to be treated as if they are the same type of object. Just like how Max and Buddy are both treated as dogs, even though they are different breeds. In programming, Polymorphism allows us to write code that can work with different types of objects, as long as those objects have certain common traits or behaviors. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine that we have a program that needs to display the sound that different animals make. We could write a simple function that takes an object and calls a method called \"make_sound\" on that object. This function would work with any object that has a \"make_sound\" method, regardless of what type of animal it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, that's Polymorphism in a nutshell. It's a simple concept that allows us to write more flexible and reusable code. I hope that this metaphor has helped you understand it a little better. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!"

    "# Introduction to Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the class on Object-Oriented Programming. Today we will be discussing the concept of Polymorphism in OOP. Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to behave in a similar way. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand Polymorphism, let's first understand what an object is. An object is an instance of a class, which has its own methods and attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example of a class called Animal. This class has a method called make_sound() which returns the sound made by the animal. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create a few subclasses of the Animal class, which will override the make_sound() method to return their own unique sound. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return 'Woof!'\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return 'Meow!'\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cow(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return 'Moo!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, Dog, Cat, and Cow classes are subclasses of the Animal class. They have their own implementations of the make_sound() method, which override the implementation in the parent class. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Using Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create an instance of each subclass and call the make_sound() method on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "cow = Cow()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog.make_sound())\n",
    "print(cat.make_sound())\n",
    "print(cow.make_sound())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we execute the above code, we get the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Woof!\n",
    "Meow!\n",
    "Moo!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, all the subclasses have different implementations of the make_sound() method, but we can call the same method on all the objects and they return their own unique sound. This is an example of Polymorphism. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Polymorphism is a powerful concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to behave in a similar way. In our example, we had different animals that made different sounds, but we were able to call the same method on all the objects to get their unique sound. I hope you have a better understanding of Polymorphism now."

    "Design a program that simulates a library. The library has different types of books, such as novels, textbooks, and reference books. Each type of book has a title, author, and number of pages. \n",

Each child class should have its own unique method, such as Novel class having a method to display the genre, Textbook class having a method to display the subject, and ReferenceBook class having a method to display the category. \n",

When a book is added to the library, it will be added as a Book object, but when the program displays the book's information, it will call the child class's method based on the book's type."

    "polymorphism properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of the same class. In other words, it provides a way to write code that can work with objects of different types without knowing their specific type at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how polymorphism can be used in Java:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Shape.java\n",
    "public abstract class Shape {\n",
    "    public abstract double area();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Circle.java\n",

    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public double area() {\n",
    "        return width * height;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// PolymorphismExample.java\n",
    "public class PolymorphismExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Shape shape1 = new Circle(5);\n",
    "        Shape shape2 = new Rectangle(4, 6);\n",
    "\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Area of shape1: \" + shape1.area());\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Area of shape2: \" + shape2.area());\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have an abstract `Shape` class with an abstract `area()` method. We also have two concrete classes, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, that extend the `Shape` class and implement the `area()` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `PolymorphismExample` class, we create two objects, `shape1` and `shape2`, of type `Shape`. However, the actual objects created are `Circle` and `Rectangle` objects, respectively. We can call the `area()` method on both objects, even though they are of different types, because they both inherit the `area()` method from the `Shape` class. This is an example of polymorphism in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test if you have implemented polymorphism properly, you can create three assertion tests. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "public class PolymorphismTest {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Shape shape1 = new Circle(5);\n",
    "        Shape shape2 = new Rectangle(4, 6);\n",
    "\n",
    "        assert shape1.area() == 78.53981633974483 : \"Test 1 failed\";\n",
    "        assert shape2.area() == 24 : \"Test 2 failed\";\n",
    "        assert shape1.getClass() == Circle.class : \"Test 3 failed\";\n",
    "\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"All tests passed\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this test, we create two objects of type `Shape`, just like in the previous example. We then use assertions to check if the `area()` method of each object returns the expected value. We also use an assertion to check if the `getClass()` method of `shape1` returns the `Circle` class, which is what we expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all tests pass, we print a message indicating that all tests passed. If any test fails, an error message will be printed indicating which test failed."
