    "Hello everyone! Today we are going to talk about classes and objects in computer science. To understand this concept, let me give you a simple metaphor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a bakery, and you want to create a new type of cake. You start by creating a blueprint or a recipe for the cake. This recipe contains instructions on how to make the cake, what ingredients to use, and how to decorate it. This blueprint is like a class in computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to actually make the cake, you need to use the recipe as a guide and create a physical cake. This physical cake is like an object in computer science. You can create multiple cakes using the same recipe, but each cake will have its own physical presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in computer science, a class is a blueprint or a template that contains instructions on how to create objects. An object is a physical instance of a class that has its own unique characteristics and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like how you can modify the recipe to create different types of cakes, you can modify the class to create different types of objects. You can add new attributes or methods to the class to create objects with different behaviors and characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a class is like a recipe or a blueprint that contains instructions on how to create objects, and an object is a physical instance of a class that has its own unique characteristics and behavior. I hope this metaphor helps you understand the concept of classes and objects in computer science."

    "# Classes and Objects in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It provides a way to define the characteristics and behaviors of an object. An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that exists in memory during the execution of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Car Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are building a program to simulate a car dealership. We need to represent each car in the dealership as an object. To do this, we can define a Car class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "        self.odometer_reading = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `__init__` is a special method that gets called when a new object is created. It initializes the object's attributes with the values passed in as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have defined a Car class with four attributes: `make`, `model`, `year`, and `odometer_reading`. The `odometer_reading` attribute is initialized to `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create an object of this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_car = Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2021)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have created a new Car object called `my_car`. We passed in the values `'Toyota'`, `'Corolla'`, and `2021` as arguments to the `__init__` method, which initializes the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now access the attributes of the object using the dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(my_car.make)\n",
    "print(my_car.model)\n",
    "print(my_car.year)\n",
    "print(my_car.odometer_reading)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Toyota\n",
    "Corolla\n",
    "2021\n",
    "0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also modify the attributes of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_car.odometer_reading = 100\n",
    "print(my_car.odometer_reading)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and objects are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. They allow us to represent real-world entities in our programs and define their attributes and behaviors. In this example, we defined a Car class and created a Car object. We accessed and modified the object's attributes using the dot notation."

    "Okay, let me first explain what classes and objects are.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects that define a set of properties and methods. An object is an instance of a class that contains data and methods to operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a class called \"Car\" that defines the properties of a car such as the make, model, and year. We can create an object of this class called \"myCar\" that contains data for a specific car, such as a 2015 Toyota Corolla.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create a class called \"Person\" that defines the properties and methods of a person. We can create an object of this class called \"myPerson\" that contains data for a specific person, such as their name, age, and occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the code with empty methods that have comments for what they should do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age, occupation):\n",
    "        # Initialize the Person object with their name, age, and occupation\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def introduce(self):\n",

    "        # Increase the age of the person by one year\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create 3 assertion tests to test if these methods have been implemented correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Create a Person object with the name \"John\", age 25, and occupation \"student\"\n",
    "myPerson = Person(\"John\", 25, \"student\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test the introduce() method\n",
    "assert myPerson.introduce() == \"Hi, my name is John and I am a student.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test the get_older() method\n",
    "myPerson.get_older()\n",
    "assert myPerson.age == 26\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test the __init__() method\n",
    "assert myPerson.name == \"John\" and myPerson.age == 25 and myPerson.occupation == \"student\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These assertion tests will help the students ensure that their code is working properly and that the methods are implemented correctly."
