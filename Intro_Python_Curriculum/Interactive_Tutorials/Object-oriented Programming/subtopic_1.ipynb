    "## Inheritance: Building a Family Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming where you can create new classes based on existing classes. It's like building a family tree where the child inherits traits from their parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine that we have a class called `Animal`. This class has properties and methods that define what an animal is and what it can do. Now, let's say we want to create a new class called `Dog`. A dog is an animal, so it makes sense to use the `Animal` class as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create the `Dog` class and have it inherit all the properties and methods of the `Animal` class. This means that `Dog` automatically has all the traits of `Animal`, plus any additional traits that we define specifically for `Dog`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in a family tree, a child inherits traits from their parents but can also have their own unique traits. Similarly, a class that inherits from another class can have its own unique properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a powerful concept in object-oriented programming because it allows us to reuse code and avoid duplicating efforts. We can create a base class with common functionality and then create subclasses that inherit and extend that functionality as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, inheritance is like building a family tree where children inherit traits from their parents. Similarly, a subclass inherits properties and methods from its parent class, allowing for code reuse and extension."

    "# Introduction to Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. It is a way of creating new classes that are built upon existing classes. Inheritance enables you to define a new class that inherits properties and methods from an existing class. The existing class is called the base class or parent class, and the new class is called the derived class or child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the following example of a `Person` class that stores information about a person's name and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def introduce(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hi, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we have defined a `Person` class with an `__init__` method that initializes the `name` and `age` attributes, and an `introduce` method that prints out information about the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's say we want to create a `Student` class that inherits from the `Person` class but also has a `school` attribute. We can do this using inheritance as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student(Person):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age, school):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name, age)\n",
    "        self.school = school\n",
    "\n",
    "    def introduce(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hi, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old. I go to {self.school}.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we have defined a `Student` class that inherits from the `Person` class using the `Person` class as the base class. We have overridden the `introduce` method to include information about the `school` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can create instances of the `Person` and `Student` classes and call their `introduce` methods as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person = Person(\"John\", 25)\n",
    "person.introduce()  # Output: Hi, my name is John and I am 25 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "student = Student(\"Jane\", 20, \"ABC University\")\n",
    "student.introduce()  # Output: Hi, my name is Jane and I am 20 years old. I go to ABC University.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the `Student` class inherits the `introduce` method from the `Person` class but also adds additional functionality specific to the `Student` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a powerful tool in object-oriented programming that allows you to create new classes that inherit properties and methods from existing classes. By using inheritance, you can avoid duplicating code and make your code more modular and extensible."

    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class called \"Animal\" that has the following attributes: \"name\", \"age\", and \"species\". The \"name\" attribute should be a string, the \"age\" attribute should be an integer, and the \"species\" attribute should be a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create two subclasses of \"Animal\" called \"Dog\" and \"Cat\". Each subclass should have an additional attribute called \"breed\". The \"breed\" attribute should be a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Dog\" subclass should have a method called \"bark\" that returns the string \"Woof!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Cat\" subclass should have a method called \"meow\" that returns the string \"Meow!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an instance of each subclass, set their attributes, and call their respective methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Max\", 3, \"Dog\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "print(dog.bark()) # Output: Woof!\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat(\"Mittens\", 2, \"Cat\", \"Siamese\")\n",
    "print(cat.meow()) # Output: Meow!\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem requires students to understand the concept of inheritance and how it allows subclasses to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class. They will also practice creating and using subclasses with additional attributes and methods. The problem is of appropriate difficulty for first year computer science students as it is relatively simple but requires an understanding of basic programming concepts."

    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. It allows you to define a new class based on an existing class, inheriting all of its properties and methods. The new class is called the subclass, and the existing class is called the superclass. The subclass can add its own properties and methods, or override the ones inherited from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "class Animal:\n",

    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    # Inherits from Animal class\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        # Override speak method\n",
    "        return \"Woof\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    # Inherits from Animal class\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        # Override speak method\n",
    "        return \"Meow\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, we have a superclass `Animal` with an `__init__` method and a `speak` method. The `__init__` method initializes the `name` property of the animal. The `speak` method is empty in the superclass and will be overridden in the subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have two subclasses: `Dog` and `Cat`. Both of them inherit from the `Animal` superclass and override the `speak` method to return a different sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create some assertion tests to ensure our implementation is correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def test_dog_speak():\n",
    "    dog = Dog(\"Fido\")\n",
    "    assert dog.speak() == \"Woof\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_cat_speak():\n",
    "    cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "    assert cat.speak() == \"Meow\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_animal_init():\n",
    "    animal = Animal(\"Bob\")\n",
    "    assert animal.name == \"Bob\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These assertion tests create instances of our classes and test their properties and methods. If all tests pass, we can be confident that our inheritance implementation is correct."
