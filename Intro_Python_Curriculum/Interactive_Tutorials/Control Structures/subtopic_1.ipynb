    "Hello everyone, today we will be discussing an important topic in computer science, which is Loops. In computer science, loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let me give you a metaphor to explain loops. Let's imagine you are a cashier at a grocery store. A customer comes to you with a basket of items. You need to scan each item and add it to their bill. This process is repeated for every customer who comes to your counter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you were to write a program for this scenario, you would need to use loops. A loop would allow you to repeat the process of scanning each item and adding it to the bill for every customer who comes to your counter. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of loops: the for loop and the while loop. The for loop is used when you know the number of times you need to execute the code. For example, in our scenario, you know the number of customers in the queue, so you can use a for loop to execute the code for each customer. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the while loop is used when you don't know the number of times you need to execute the code. For example, in our scenario, you might have a situation where customers keep coming to your counter until the store closes. In this case, you can use a while loop to keep executing the code until the store closes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, loops are an important concept in computer science and are used in many programs. Just like a cashier at a grocery store needs to repeat the process of scanning each item and adding it to the bill for every customer who comes to their counter, a program also needs to repeat a block of code multiple times, and that's where loops come in handy."

    "# Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, loops are used to execute a set of instructions repeatedly until a particular condition is met. Python has two types of loops - `for` and `while` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements. The sequence can be a list, tuple, set, or a string. Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a list of fruits and we use a `for` loop to iterate over each element of the list and print it. The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "apple\n",
    "banana\n",
    "cherry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `in` keyword to define the sequence we want to iterate over. The variable `fruit` is used to hold the current element of the sequence in each iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## While Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop is used to execute a set of instructions repeatedly as long as a particular condition is true. Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 1\n",
    "while i <= 5:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i = i + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we initialize a variable `i` to 1 and use a `while` loop to print the value of `i` and increment it by 1 in each iteration, until `i` is no longer less than or equal to 5. The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `while` keyword to define the condition that needs to be true for the loop to continue executing. In each iteration of the loop, we need to update the value of the variable that defines the condition, otherwise the loop will execute indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are an essential part of programming, allowing us to execute a set of instructions repeatedly until a certain condition is met. `for` loops are used to iterate over a sequence of elements, while `while` loops are used to execute a set of instructions repeatedly as long as a particular condition is true."

The loop iterates from 1 to 10, multiplying the input number with each iteration and printing out the result.
