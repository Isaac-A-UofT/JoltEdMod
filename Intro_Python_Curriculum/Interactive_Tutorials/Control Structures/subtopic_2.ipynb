    "Loop control statements are like a group of friends who are planning to go on a trip together. Just as the group leader needs to make sure everyone stays together, loop control statements help to manage the flow of code within a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you and your friends are on a trip to a new city. You've planned out your itinerary and have a list of places you want to visit. As you explore the city, you need to make sure everyone stays together and that no one gets left behind. This is where loop control statements come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a loop, you have a set of instructions that need to be repeated a certain number of times or until a condition is met. Just like you need to keep your group together while exploring the city, loop control statements help you manage the execution of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you're visiting a museum with your friends, you might need to make sure everyone has finished looking at one exhibit before moving onto the next one. In programming terms, you can use a loop control statement like \"break\" to exit the loop early if the condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you're visiting a park and want to make sure everyone gets a chance to ride the carousel, you might use a loop control statement like \"continue\" to skip over certain iterations of the loop and make sure everyone gets their turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, loop control statements help you manage the flow of code in a loop, just as you need to manage the flow of your group when exploring a new city."

    "# Loop Control Statements in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop control statements in Python are used to control the flow of a loop. They allow you to modify the behavior of a loop in certain situations. In this tutorial, we will discuss three loop control statements in Python: break, continue, and pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Break Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `break` statement is used to terminate a loop prematurely. When the `break` statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program continues executing from the next statement after the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a break statement\n",
    "for i in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    if i == 5:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop will terminate when `i` is equal to 5. The output of the program will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continue Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement is used to skip over an iteration of a loop. When the `continue` statement is encountered inside a loop, the current iteration is skipped and the next iteration begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a continue statement\n",
    "for i in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    if i == 5:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop will skip over the iteration when `i` is equal to 5. The output of the program will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "6\n",
    "7\n",
    "8\n",
    "9\n",
    "10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pass Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pass` statement is used as a placeholder in situations where a statement is required syntactically, but no code needs to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a pass statement\n",
    "for i in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    if i == 5:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop will not skip over the iteration when `i` is equal to 5. Instead, the `pass` statement will be executed, which does nothing. The output of the program will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "6\n",
    "7\n",
    "8\n",
    "9\n",
    "10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, loop control statements in Python are used to control the flow of a loop. The `break` statement is used to terminate a loop prematurely, the `continue` statement is used to skip over an iteration of a loop, and the `pass` statement is used as a placeholder in situations where a statement is required, but no code needs to be executed."

    "Problem: Write a program to calculate the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to n using a loop control statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Ask the user to input a positive integer n.\n",
    "2. Use a loop control statement to iterate through all the numbers from 1 to n.\n",
    "3. Check if each number is even or odd using the modulo operator (%).\n",
    "4. If a number is even, add it to a running total sum.\n",
    "5. Once the loop is completed, print out the total sum of even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter a positive integer: 10\n",
    "The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This problem requires the use of a loop control statement (e.g. for loop or while loop) and the modulo operator. It is of an appropriate difficulty for first-year computer science students who have learned basic programming concepts such as variables, data types, and basic control statements."
