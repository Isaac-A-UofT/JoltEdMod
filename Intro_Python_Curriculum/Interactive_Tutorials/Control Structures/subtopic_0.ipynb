    "In programming, we use conditional statements to make decisions based on certain conditions. Just like in the choose-your-own-adventure book, we have different paths we can take based on the choices we make. \n",

    "For example, let's say we're writing a program to determine if a number is positive or negative. We can use an if-else statement to make that decision. If the number is greater than 0, we can say it's positive. If it's less than or equal to 0, we can say it's negative. \n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello everyone, today we are going to learn about conditional statements in programming. In programming, we often encounter situations where we need to make decisions based on certain conditions. This is where conditional statements come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Conditional Statements?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are used to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. They are also known as if-else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for conditional statements in most programming languages is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    statement1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    statement2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above syntax, `condition` is the expression that is evaluated to either `True` or `False`. If `condition` is `True`, then `statement1` is executed. Otherwise, `statement2` is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example to understand this better. Suppose we want to write a program that checks whether a given number is even or odd. Here's how we would do it using conditional statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# take input from the user\n",
    "num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# check if the number is even or odd\n",
    "if num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "    print(num, \"is even\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(num, \"is odd\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we take input from the user using the `input()` function and convert it to an integer using the `int()` function. We then check if the number is even or odd using the `%` operator. If the remainder when the number is divided by 2 is 0, then the number is even and we print `\"is even\"`. Otherwise, we print `\"is odd\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are a very important concept in programming and are used extensively. They allow us to write programs that can make decisions based on certain conditions, making our programs more dynamic and flexible."

    "Problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and prints whether the number is even or odd. If the number is even, the program should also print the square of the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Output: \n",

    "\n",
    "Output: \n",

    "Input: 7\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "7 is odd \n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "The program should first take an integer input from the user using the input() function. It should then use an if statement to check if the number is even or odd. If the number is even, it should print the square of the number using the ** operator. If the number is odd, it should simply print that the number is odd. \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem involves the use of conditional statements and basic arithmetic operations, making it an appropriate difficulty level for first year computer science students."
