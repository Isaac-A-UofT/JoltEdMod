    "Python is like a Swiss Army Knife for computer science. Just as a Swiss Army Knife has many tools in one compact package, Python has many features and applications that make it a versatile language for programming. \n",

    "Python is a high-level language, which means that it is easier to read and write than low-level languages like assembly. It is also an interpreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled before it can be run. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the strengths of Python is its simplicity. Its syntax is straightforward and requires fewer lines of code to achieve the same result as other languages. This makes it an ideal language for beginners to learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also an object-oriented language, which means that it allows you to define your own data types and operations that can act on them. This makes it an ideal language for building complex applications. \n",

    "In summary, Python is a powerful and versatile language that is easy to learn and use. Its simplicity and object-oriented features make it an ideal choice for beginners and experts alike."

    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the world of Python programming! Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is becoming increasingly popular in the world of computer science. In this lecture, we will explore some of the key features and applications of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with an example of basic Python syntax. The following code block prints the message \"Hello, world!\" to the console:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Python is a very straightforward language to learn. In this example, the `print()` function is used to output a message to the console. The message is passed as an argument to the function, inside parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key feature of Python is its use of variables. Variables are used to store data that can be used later in the program. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the variable `x` is assigned the value of `5`. The value can be accessed later in the program by referring to the variable name. The `print()` function is used again to output the value of the variable to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a variety of data types, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = 2.5\n",
    "z = \"Hello\"\n",
    "w = True\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "print(y)\n",
    "print(z)\n",
    "print(w)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, four variables are defined, each with a different data type. `x` is an integer, `y` is a float, `z` is a string, and `w` is a boolean. The `print()` function is used to output the value of each variable to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a variety of control structures, including if-else statements and loops. Here's an example of an if-else statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "if x > 10:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 10\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is less than or equal to 10\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, an if-else statement is used to check if the value of `x` is greater than `10`. If it is, the message \"x is greater than 10\" is printed to the console. If it is not, the message \"x is less than or equal to 10\" is printed instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a for loop is used to iterate over a range of numbers from 0 to 4. The `print()` function is used to output the value of the loop variable `i` to the console on each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a powerful and easy-to-learn programming language with a wide range of applications. Its simple syntax and support for a variety of data types and control structures make it an ideal choice for beginners and experts alike. We hope this introduction has helped you get started with Python programming!"

    "Problem: Palindrome Checker\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python program that will take a string as input and determine whether or not the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same way forwards and backwards. For example, \"racecar\" is a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should ignore whitespace and punctuation characters. For example, \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\" is a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should output \"Yes\" if the input string is a palindrome and \"No\" otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Input and Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \"racecar\"\n",
    "Output: Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\"\n",
    "Output: Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \"hello world\"\n",
    "Output: No\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \"Was it a car or a cat I saw?\"\n",
    "Output: Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can use string slicing to reverse the input string.\n",
    "2. You can use the built-in string method \"isalpha()\" to determine if a character is a letter or not."

    "assert calculator.multiply(2, 3) == 6\n",
    "assert calculator.multiply(-2, 3) == -6\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "These tests will check if the `add()`, `subtract()`, and `multiply()` methods have been implemented correctly. If any of the tests fail, the student will know that they need to go back and fix their code."
