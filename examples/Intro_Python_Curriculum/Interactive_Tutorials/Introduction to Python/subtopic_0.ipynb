    "Welcome, first-year computer science students! Today, we are going to discuss one of the most popular programming languages in the world - Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is like a language that humans use to communicate with each other. For example, when you want to order food at a restaurant, you use words to convey your message to the waiter. Similarly, when you want your computer to do something, you use Python to convey your message to the computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like how there are different languages that humans use to communicate with each other, there are different programming languages that we can use to communicate with a computer. Python is a language that is easy to learn and use, which makes it a popular choice for beginners. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can write instructions that tell the computer what to do. These instructions are called code. Just like how a recipe tells you how to make a dish, code tells the computer how to perform a task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also a versatile language that can be used for a variety of tasks such as web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. It is a language that is constantly evolving and improving, which makes it an exciting language to learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Python is a language that allows us to communicate with computers by writing code. It is easy to learn and use, versatile, and constantly evolving. I hope you will enjoy learning Python and exploring all the amazing things you can do with it!"

    "# What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. It is designed to be easy to read and write, with a simple syntax that is easy to learn. Python is a popular language for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a simple Python program that demonstrates some of the basic features of the language. This program will ask the user for their name, and then greet them with a personalized message.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Ask the user for their name\n",
    "name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Greet the user with a personalized message\n",
    "print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"! Welcome to Python.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, we use the `input()` function to ask the user for their name. The `input()` function allows us to get input from the user, and returns it as a string. We then store the user's name in a variable called `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use the `print()` function to display a personalized message to the user. The `print()` function allows us to output text to the console. We use the `+` operator to concatenate the user's name with the rest of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simple example, but it demonstrates some of the basic features of Python. We can use variables to store data, and use functions to manipulate that data. We can also get input from the user and output information to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that can be used for a wide variety of applications. Its simple syntax and ease of use make it a popular choice for beginners, but it is also a powerful tool for experienced developers. Whether you are interested in web development, data analysis, or artificial intelligence, Python is a language that is worth learning."

    "Problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python program that takes in a user's name and age, and then prints out a personalized message that includes the user's name and the year they will turn 100 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Begin by asking the user for their name and age using the input() function.\n",
    "2. Calculate the year the user will turn 100 years old by subtracting their current age from 100, and then adding the current year to the result.\n",
    "3. Print out a personalized message that includes the user's name and the year they will turn 100 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter your name: John\n",
    "Enter your age: 25\n",
    "Hello John! You will turn 100 in the year 2096.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This problem will test the student's knowledge of Python's input() function, basic arithmetic operations, and string concatenation. It is appropriate for first year computer science students as it is not particularly challenging, but it still requires some basic programming concepts to be understood."
