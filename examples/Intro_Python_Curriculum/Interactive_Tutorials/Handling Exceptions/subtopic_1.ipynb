    "As a first year computer science student, you are learning how to write programs that solve problems and perform tasks. Sometimes, though, your program might run into an error or an unexpected problem. This is where Try, except, and finally blocks come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like baking a cake. You follow the recipe, measure out the ingredients, and put it in the oven. But what if the oven breaks down? Or what if you accidentally put in too much salt? Your cake might not turn out the way you wanted it to. \n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, the Try block is like the baking process. You write your code and try to execute it. The except block is like having a backup plan. If something goes wrong, you can catch the error and handle it in a specific way. This way, your program doesn't just crash and leave you with a broken cake. Finally block is like cleaning up. It runs after the try and except blocks have executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary, Try, except, and finally blocks help you handle errors and unexpected problems in your program, just like having a backup plan when baking a cake."

    "# Try, Except, Finally Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, errors occur frequently due to a variety of reasons such as incorrect user input, hardware malfunctions, or coding errors. We don't want our programs to crash whenever an error occurs, which is why we use exception handling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling is a mechanism that allows us to gracefully handle errors that occur during the execution of our program. Try, except, and finally blocks are a core part of exception handling in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at an example to understand how try, except, and finally blocks work.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = x / y\n",
    "        print(\"The result is\", result)\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\")\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        print(\"Executing finally clause\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we defined a function called \"divide\" that takes in two parameters \"x\" and \"y\". The function divides \"x\" by \"y\" and prints the result. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if \"y\" is equal to zero, the program will throw a ZeroDivisionError. Instead of crashing the program, we can handle this exception by wrapping the code that may cause an error in a try block. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code inside the try block is executed first, and if an exception occurs, it is caught by the except block. In this example, we catch the ZeroDivisionError exception and print an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The finally block is executed after the try and except blocks, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is used to perform cleanup actions, such as closing a file or releasing a resource, that should be executed no matter what happens in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's test our function with some values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "divide(10, 2)\n",
    "divide(5, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The result is 5.0\n",
    "Executing finally clause\n",
    "Error: Division by zero is not allowed\n",
    "Executing finally clause\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the first division operation was successful and the result was printed. The second division operation raised a ZeroDivisionError, which was caught by the except block, and an error message was printed. Finally, the code in the finally block was executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, try, except, and finally blocks are used to handle exceptions in Python. The try block contains the code that may cause an error, the except block catches the exception and handles it gracefully, and the finally block performs cleanup actions that should be executed no matter what happens in the try block."
