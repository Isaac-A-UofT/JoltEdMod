    "Welcome to the class on Exception Handling. In programming, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. It is an error that occurs while your program is running and can cause your program to stop working. Exception handling is a technique that is used to handle such errors in a graceful manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of exception handling like a fire alarm in your house. Just like a fire alarm will alert you if there is a fire in your house, exception handling will alert you if there is an error in your program. When the fire alarm goes off, you do not panic and run out of the house immediately. Instead, you follow a well-defined protocol to ensure your safety and minimize damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, when an exception occurs in your program, you do not panic and shut down your program immediately. Instead, you use exception handling to gracefully handle the error and ensure that your program does not crash. You can use try-catch blocks to catch the exception and handle it in a way that makes sense for your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are writing a program that reads data from a file, there may be times when the file is not available or the data is corrupt. In such a scenario, your program can throw an exception. By using exception handling, you can catch the exception and display a meaningful message to the user, instead of crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, just like a fire alarm helps you handle emergencies in your house, exception handling helps you handle errors in your program in a graceful manner. By using exception handling, you can ensure that your program continues to run smoothly, even when unexpected errors occur."

    "# Exception Handling Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, an exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. These exceptions are usually caused by errors in the code or unexpected input from the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "To handle these exceptions properly, we use **exception handling** in our code. Exception handling allows us to gracefully handle errors and prevent our program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example to understand exception handling. Suppose we have a program that takes two integer inputs from the user and then divides the first input by the second input. Here's what the code might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n",
    "num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n",
    "result = num1 / num2\n",
    "print(\"The result is: \", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose the user enters `0` as the second input. This would result in a **ZeroDivisionError**, since we cannot divide a number by zero. This error would cause our program to crash and stop executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this error, we can use a **try-except** block. Here's what the updated code would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n",
    "    num2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n",
    "    result = num1 / num2\n",
    "    print(\"The result is: \", result)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if the user enters `0` as the second input, the **ZeroDivisionError** will be caught by the `except` block and our program will continue executing without crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exception handling is an important concept in programming that allows us to gracefully handle errors and prevent our programs from crashing. By using try-except blocks, we can catch and handle specific types of errors, allowing our programs to run smoothly even in the face of unexpected input or errors in our code."

    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that takes input from the user in the form of two integers a and b, and performs the division operation a/b. If the value of b is zero, handle the exception and print \"Division by Zero Error\".\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Write a program that takes two integers a and b as input from the user using the input function.\n",
    "2. Use a try-except block to handle the exception in case b is zero.\n",
    "3. If b is zero, print the message \"Division by Zero Error\"\n",
    "4. If b is not zero, perform the division operation a/b and print the result.\n",

    "Question: How do we handle exceptions in Java programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In Java programming, we use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions. We enclose the code that may throw an exception in a try block, and then provide one or more catch blocks to handle the exception if it occurs. We can also include a finally block to execute code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
