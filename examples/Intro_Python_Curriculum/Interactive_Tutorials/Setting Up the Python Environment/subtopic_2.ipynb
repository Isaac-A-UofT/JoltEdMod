    "Greetings, first-year computer science students! Today we will be discussing using the command line, which is a powerful tool that can help you interact with your computer in new and exciting ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the command line as a chef's kitchen. Just as a chef needs to use various tools and techniques to create a delicious meal, you can use the command line to accomplish a wide range of tasks with your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you want to create a new folder on your desktop. Rather than clicking around with your mouse, you can simply use a command like \"mkdir\" to create the folder right from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, let's say you want to find a specific file on your computer. Using the command line, you can search through all of your files and folders quickly and easily, much like a chef might look through their pantry for a certain spice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line may seem intimidating at first, but with practice, you'll soon find that it's an incredibly useful tool that can help you become more efficient and productive in your computer work. So don't be afraid to experiment and explore - just like a chef in the kitchen, you may be surprised at what you can create with the right tools at your disposal!"

    "# Using the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome, first year computer science students!\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we're going to talk about using the command line. The command line is a way to interact with your computer using text commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use the command line?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering, why would I want to use the command line when I can use a graphical user interface (GUI) like Windows or macOS? Well, there are a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Speed:** Once you get the hang of it, using the command line can be much faster than using a GUI. You can navigate to different directories, create and delete files, and perform other tasks with just a few keystrokes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Power:** The command line gives you access to a wide range of tools and utilities that you might not have access to otherwise. For example, you can use command line tools to automate tasks, manipulate large datasets, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** The command line is highly customizable, and you can create your own scripts and commands to perform tasks that are specific to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by looking at some basic commands that you can use in the command line. Open up a terminal or command prompt to follow along.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `cd`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cd` command is used to change directories. For example, if you want to navigate to your home directory, you can type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ~\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `~` symbol is a shortcut for your home directory. You should now be in your home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ls`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ls` command is used to list the contents of a directory. For example, if you want to list the contents of your home directory, you can type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a list of files and directories in your home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `mkdir`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mkdir` command is used to create a new directory. For example, if you want to create a new directory called \"my_folder\", you can type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir my_folder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now have a new directory called \"my_folder\" in your current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `touch`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `touch` command is used to create a new file. For example, if you want to create a new file called \"my_file.txt\", you can type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "touch my_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now have a new file called \"my_file.txt\" in your current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `rm`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `rm` command is used to delete files. For example, if you want to delete the file \"my_file.txt\", you can type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rm my_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The file should now be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for our brief introduction to using the command line. These are just a few basic commands, but there are many more that you can use to perform a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the command line can be a powerful tool, but it can also be dangerous if used improperly. Always be careful when using commands like `rm`, and make sure you know what you're doing before you execute a command."

    "Write a program that takes a directory path as input from the command line and outputs the number of files in that directory. \n",

    "Constraints: \n",
    "- The program should be written in Python.\n",
    "- The program should only use command line arguments to get the directory path.\n",
