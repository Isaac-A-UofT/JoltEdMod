    "## Understanding Dictionaries in Computer Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a librarian in a big library with thousands of books. In order to keep track of all the books, you create a catalog that lists the title, author, and location of each book. The catalog is arranged in alphabetical order by the title of the book, so you can easily find a book by looking at the title.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, think of a dictionary as a catalog for your data. Instead of listing books, a dictionary lists key-value pairs. The key is like the title of a book, and the value is like the author and location. Just like in a catalog, the keys in a dictionary are unique, and they are used to look up the corresponding value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you have a dictionary of fruits. The keys could be the names of the fruits, and the values could be the color, shape, and taste of each fruit. If you want to find out what color an apple is, you would look up the key \"apple\" in the dictionary, and the corresponding value would tell you that apples are usually red or green.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, dictionaries are commonly used to store and retrieve data quickly and efficiently. They are especially useful when you need to look up values based on a specific key. For example, you could use a dictionary to store information about students in a class, with the student IDs as the keys and their names and grades as the values. Then, you could quickly look up a student's name and grade by searching for their ID in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, dictionaries are a powerful tool for organizing and accessing data in computer science. By understanding how they work and how to use them effectively, you can become a more skilled and efficient programmer."

    "# Dictionaries in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the class, today we will be discussing Dictionaries in Python. Dictionaries are a type of data structure in Python that allow us to store and retrieve data using key-value pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, imagine a real life dictionary where you look up a word and find its meaning. Similarly, in a Python dictionary, we have a key (the word) and its corresponding value (the meaning).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a dictionary of some fruits and their colors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = {\"apple\": \"red\", \"banana\": \"yellow\", \"grape\": \"purple\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `fruits` is the name of our dictionary, and inside the braces `{}` we've specified the key-value pairs separated by colons `:`. The key is the name of the fruit and the value is its color.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing a Value\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the value of a key, we can use square brackets `[]` and provide the key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(fruits[\"apple\"]) # Output: red\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we're accessing the value of the key `\"apple\"` and printing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding or Modifying a Value\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a new key-value pair or modify an existing one, we can simply assign a value to a new or existing key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits[\"orange\"] = \"orange\"\n",
    "fruits[\"apple\"] = \"green\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we've added a new key-value pair `\"orange\": \"orange\"` and also modified the value of an existing key `\"apple\": \"green\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Removing a Key-Value Pair\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove a key-value pair from the dictionary, we can use the `del` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "del fruits[\"grape\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we're removing the key-value pair `\"grape\": \"purple\"` from the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Looping Through a Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "We can loop through a dictionary using a `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for fruit, color in fruits.items():\n",
    "    print(f\"The color of {fruit} is {color}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we're using the `items()` method of the dictionary to get a list of key-value pairs. We're then looping through this list and printing the key and value in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all for today's class. Dictionaries are a very useful data structure in Python and are used extensively in many programs. I hope you found this introduction to dictionaries helpful."

    "Create a program that takes a list of names as input and outputs the number of times each name appears in the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, you can use a dictionary where the keys are the names and the values are the number of times each name appears in the list. You can iterate through the list of names and check if each name is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, you can increment the value associated with that key. If it isn't, you can add it to the dictionary with a value of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have processed all the names in the list, you can output the contents of the dictionary to show the number of times each name appeared. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example input:\n",
    "[\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Alice\", \"David\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example output:\n",
    "Alice: 3\n",
    "Bob: 2\n",
    "Charlie: 1\n",
    "David: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is appropriate for first year computer science students as it requires a basic understanding of dictionaries and iterating through lists. It also encourages students to think about how to store and manipulate data in a program."
