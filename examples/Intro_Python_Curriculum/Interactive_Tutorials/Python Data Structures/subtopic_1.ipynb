    "Greetings, first-year computer science students. Today, we will be discussing Tuples, a fundamental concept in computer programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple is a data structure that is similar to a list, but with one key difference - it is immutable. This means that once you create a tuple, you cannot change its values. Think of a tuple as a sealed envelope. Once you put something inside and seal it, you cannot change what's inside or add or remove anything from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you might be wondering, \"Why would we want to use something that we cannot change?\" Well, just like a sealed envelope, tuples are useful for situations where you want to ensure that the data remains unchanged. For example, imagine you are designing a game, and you want to keep track of the player's score, level, and remaining lives. You wouldn't want these values to accidentally change during gameplay, so you would use a tuple to keep them secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another analogy for tuples is a set of instructions that come with a new toy. The instructions tell you what the toy is, what it does, and how to use it, but you cannot change the instructions themselves. They are fixed and immutable. Similarly, tuples provide a fixed set of values that describe something, and these values cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, tuples are a useful data structure in programming that allow us to keep data secure and unchangeable. Think of them like a sealed envelope or a set of instructions that come with a new toy. I hope this explanation has helped you understand tuples better. Thank you for listening."

    "# Tuples in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello everyone, today we are going to talk about Tuples in Python. Tuples are similar to lists in Python, but they have some key differences. We will start by defining what a tuple is and how it differs from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Tuple?\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple is an ordered collection of elements enclosed in parentheses ( ) and separated by commas. The elements can be of any data type. For example, a tuple of integers can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be modified. This is different from lists, which are mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a tuple to illustrate how they work. We will create a tuple of three elements: a string, an integer, and a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (\"apple\", 42, 3.14)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we created a tuple with three elements, each of a different data type. We can access individual elements in the tuple using indexing, just like we do with lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(my_tuple[0]) # Output: \"apple\"\n",
    "print(my_tuple[1]) # Output: 42\n",
    "print(my_tuple[2]) # Output: 3.14\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modifying a Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, tuples are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be modified. Let's try to modify an element in the tuple and see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple[0] = \"orange\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see an error message that says \"TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\". This is because we are trying to modify an element in the tuple, which is not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuple Packing and Unpacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple packing is the process of assigning values to a tuple. Tuple unpacking is the reverse process, where we assign the values of a tuple to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = 1, 2, 3\n",
    "print(my_tuple) # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "x, y, z = my_tuple\n",
    "print(x) # Output: 1\n",
    "print(y) # Output: 2\n",
    "print(z) # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we created a tuple with three values and assigned it to the variable `my_tuple`. We then unpacked the values of `my_tuple` and assigned them to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, tuples are an ordered collection of elements, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. They are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be modified. Tuple packing and unpacking are useful techniques for working with tuples."

    "Problem: \n",
    "You are given a list of tuples where each tuple represents the name, age and height of a person. You need to write a Python function that takes this list as input and returns a list of names of the people who are above 6 feet tall and are under the age of 30.\n",

    "Function Signature:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "Output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "['John', 'David']\n",
    "```\n",

    "- John is 25 years old and 6.2 feet tall, so he satisfies the condition.\n",
    "- Sarah is 28 years old but only 5.7 feet tall, so she does not satisfy the condition.\n",
    "- David is 22 years old and 6.1 feet tall, so he satisfies the condition.\n",
