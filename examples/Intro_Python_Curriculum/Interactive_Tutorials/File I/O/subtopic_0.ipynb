    "Hello everyone, today we are going to talk about reading and writing files in computer science. Imagine you are a librarian and you have a bunch of books that you need to organize. You have two tasks - reading the books and writing down their titles in a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading a file is like opening a book and reading its contents. You can read the book from the beginning to the end or you can skip to a specific chapter or page. Similarly, when you read a file in computer science, you can start from the beginning and read the entire file or you can skip to a specific line or word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a file is like writing down the title of a book in a notebook. You can add new titles, update existing titles or delete titles that are no longer needed. Similarly, when you write a file in computer science, you can add new content, update existing content or delete content that is no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a librarian needs to be organized and keep track of all the books in the library, a computer program needs to be organized and keep track of all the files it reads and writes. And just like a librarian can use different methods to organize the books, a computer program can use different methods to read and write files.\n",

    "# Reading and Writing Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading and writing files is an important aspect of programming in any language, including Python. In Python, you can easily read and write files using built-in functions and modules. In this chapter, we will discuss how to read and write files in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To read a file in Python, you can use the built-in `open()` function. The `open()` function takes two arguments: the name of the file and the mode in which you want to open the file. The mode can be either `r` for reading or `w` for writing. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open the file in read mode\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read the contents of the file\n",
    "content = file.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the contents of the file\n",
    "print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we first open the file `example.txt` in read mode using the `open()` function. We then read the contents of the file using the `read()` method and store it in the variable `content`. Finally, we close the file using the `close()` method and print the contents of the file on the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To write to a file in Python, you can use the same `open()` function but with the mode set to `w`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open the file in write mode\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write some content to the file\n",
    "file.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we open the file `example.txt` in write mode using the `open()` function. We then write the string `'Hello, World!'` to the file using the `write()` method. Finally, we close the file using the `close()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that when you open a file in write mode, it will overwrite the existing contents of the file. If you want to append to the existing contents of the file, you can open the file in append mode by setting the mode to `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading and writing files is a fundamental aspect of programming in Python. With the built-in functions and modules, it is easy to read and write files in Python. Remember to always close the file after you are done reading or writing to avoid any potential issues."

    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been given a task by the local library to create a program that can help them manage their book inventory. The library has a file containing information about their current book inventory. Each line in the file contains the title, author name, and the number of copies available for a single book. Your task is to write a program that reads this file, allows the library staff to add and remove books from the inventory, and updates the file with the new inventory data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should have the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the file containing the current inventory data and display the data on the screen in a user-friendly format.\n",
    "2. Allow the library staff to add new books to the inventory. The staff should be able to enter the title, author name, and the number of copies available for the book.\n",
    "3. Allow the library staff to remove books from the inventory. The staff should be able to enter the title of the book they want to remove.\n",
    "4. After any change in the inventory, the program should update the file containing the new inventory data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The book inventory file should be in a text format and should contain one book's information per line.\n",
    "2. The maximum number of books in the inventory should be limited to 1000.\n",
    "3. The program should handle any errors gracefully and display appropriate error messages to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem will help first-year computer science students to learn how to read and write files in Python, as well as how to handle errors in file I/O operations. It will also help them to understand the importance of data management in real-world applications."
