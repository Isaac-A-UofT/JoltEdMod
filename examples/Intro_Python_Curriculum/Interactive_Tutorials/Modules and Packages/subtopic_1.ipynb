    "Welcome, first year computer science students! Today we are going to talk about creating your own modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply, creating a module is like building your own toolbox. Imagine you are a carpenter, and you need to complete a project. You can go to the store and buy a pre-made toolkit, but it might not have all the tools you need. Or, you can build your own custom toolbox with all the tools necessary for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, when you are programming, you might need to use functions or classes that are not readily available. You could search for pre-made modules online, but they might not have exactly what you need. That's when you can create your own module with all the functions and classes that are necessary for your specific project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like building a toolbox, creating your own module takes time and effort. You need to think about what functions or classes you need, and how they should be structured. Once you have built your module, you can reuse it in different projects, just like you can reuse your custom toolbox for different carpentry jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as you dive deeper into computer science, remember that creating your own module is like building your own toolbox. It might take some extra work, but it can save you time and help you complete your projects more efficiently."

    "# Creating your own modules\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, modules are a way to organize code into separate files, which can then be imported and used in other programs. Creating your own modules can help you reuse code and make your programs more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a file `math_functions.py` that contains some mathematical functions that we want to use in another program. We can create a module by adding a line at the top of the file that specifies the module name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# math_functions.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "def subtract(x, y):\n",
    "    return x - y\n",
    "\n",
    "def multiply(x, y):\n",
    "    return x * y\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    return x / y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use this module in another program by importing it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# main.py\n",
    "\n",
    "import math_functions\n",
    "\n",
    "print(math_functions.add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
    "print(math_functions.subtract(5, 2))  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we import the `math_functions` module and use its functions `add` and `subtract`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating your own modules can have several benefits, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code reuse: By organizing code into separate modules, you can reuse code in different programs without having to rewrite it.\n",
    "- Maintainability: Modules make it easier to maintain code by keeping related functions together and separating them from other code.\n",
    "- Readability: Modules can make code more readable by grouping related functions together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating your own modules can be a powerful tool in programming. By organizing code into separate files and importing it into other programs, you can reuse code, improve maintainability, and make your programs more readable."

    "Problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been asked to create a Python module that contains functions to perform basic mathematical operations. The module should include functions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers. In addition, the module should include a function to calculate the square root of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been given the following requirements for your module:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each function should take in two parameters, the two numbers to be operated on.\n",
    "- The add function should return the sum of the two numbers.\n",
    "- The subtract function should return the difference between the two numbers.\n",
    "- The multiply function should return the product of the two numbers.\n",
    "- The divide function should return the quotient of the two numbers.\n",
    "- The square root function should take in one parameter, the number to be square rooted, and should return the square root of that number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a Python module that meets these requirements. You should create a separate file for your module, and write test code in a separate file to ensure that your functions are working correctly. You should also make sure to include comments in your code to explain what each function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you should think about how you could extend this module to include other mathematical operations, such as finding the power of a number or calculating the factorial of a number. You don't need to implement these functions, but you should write comments explaining how you would go about implementing them."
