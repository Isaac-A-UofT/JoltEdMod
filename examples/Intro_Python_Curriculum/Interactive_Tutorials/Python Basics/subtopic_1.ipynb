    "Welcome, first-year computer science students! Today, we will be discussing variables and data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a variable as a container that holds information. Just like how you might store your clothes in a closet or your books in a backpack, variables hold different types of data. For example, you might have a variable called \"age\" that holds your age, or a variable called \"name\" that holds your name. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's talk about data types. Just like how you might organize your closet by separating your clothes into different categories like shirts, pants, and jackets, data types help us organize the different types of information that we can store in variables. \n",

    "There are many different data types, but some of the most common ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integer: This is a whole number without any decimals. Think of it like the number of pencils you have in your pencil case.\n",
    "- Float: This is a number with decimals. Think of it like the amount of water in a glass.\n",
    "- String: This is a sequence of characters, like a word or a sentence. Think of it like the title of your favorite book.\n",
    "- Boolean: This is a type that can only have two values: true or false. Think of it like a light switch that can be turned on or off.\n",

    "# Variables and Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first lecture of Computer Science 101! Today, we will be discussing one of the most fundamental concepts in programming: variables and data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is a container that holds a value. Think of it as a labeled box that you can put things into and take things out of. In programming, we use variables to store and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a variable named \"my_variable\" that holds the value \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "my_variable = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# We can print the value of the variable to the console\n",
    "print(my_variable)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a variable named `my_variable` and assign it the value `\"Hello, World!\"`. We then print the value of the variable to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "A data type is a classification of data that determines the type of operations that can be performed on it. There are many different data types in programming, but some of the most common ones include strings, integers, and floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is a sequence of characters. It is used to represent text in programming. In Python, strings are surrounded by either single or double quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a string variable named \"my_string\" that holds the value \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# We can print the value of the variable to the console\n",
    "print(my_string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a string variable named `my_string` and assign it the value `\"Hello, World!\"`. We then print the value of the variable to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer is a whole number. It is used to represent numbers in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is an integer variable named \"my_integer\" that holds the value 42\n",
    "my_integer = 42\n",
    "\n",
    "# We can print the value of the variable to the console\n",
    "print(my_integer)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create an integer variable named `my_integer` and assign it the value `42`. We then print the value of the variable to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floats\n",
    "\n",
    "A float is a decimal number. It is used to represent numbers with a fractional component in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a float variable named \"my_float\" that holds the value 3.14\n",
    "my_float = 3.14\n",
    "\n",
    "# We can print the value of the variable to the console\n",
    "print(my_float)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a float variable named `my_float` and assign it the value `3.14`. We then print the value of the variable to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables and data types are essential concepts in programming. By understanding how to use variables and work with different data types, you will be able to write more complex and powerful programs."

    "Problem: Calculate the area of a rectangle\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a program that calculates the area of a rectangle using the length and width entered by the user. The program should prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle and then calculate and display the area of the rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should use variables to store the length, width, and area of the rectangle. The length and width should be integers, and the area should be a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should also perform input validation to ensure that the length and width entered by the user are positive integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter the length of the rectangle: 5\n",
    "Enter the width of the rectangle: 3\n",
    "The area of the rectangle is: 15.0\n",
    "```\n",

    "Note: This problem involves the use of variables, data types, and input validation, which are important concepts in programming and are often used in real-world applications."
