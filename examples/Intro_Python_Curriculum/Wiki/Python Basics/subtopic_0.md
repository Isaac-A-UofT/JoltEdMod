Welcome everyone to the world of Python programming!


As you all know, programming is like learning a new language. Just as every language has its own grammar rules, Python also has its own set of syntax rules that we need to follow. 


Think of Python as a chef's recipe book. Just like how a recipe book has a set of instructions for the chef to follow, Python also has a set of instructions for the computer to follow. 


Let's take the example of a recipe for chocolate chip cookies. The recipe book will have a list of ingredients needed to make the cookies, just like how a Python program will have a list of variables that we need to define. 


Next, the recipe will have a set of instructions on how to mix the ingredients together in a specific order. Similarly, Python also has a set of instructions on how we can manipulate these variables using operators and functions to get the desired output. 


Finally, just like how we need to preheat the oven before baking the cookies, we also need to run our Python program to execute the code and get the desired output.


So, in summary, just like how a chef follows a recipe book to make delicious cookies, we also need to follow syntax rules in Python to create amazing programs. With practice and patience, just like baking, we can become better at programming and create some amazing things!


Introduction to Python Syntax
=============================


Welcome to your first year of Computer Science! Today we will be learning about the basics of Python syntax. 


Variables and Data Types
------------------------


In Python, variables are used to store data values. Below is an example of how to assign a value to a variable:


```python


Assigning the value 5 to the variable x
=======================================


x = 5
```


Python supports several data types, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Here's a brief overview of each:


* **Integers** are whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, etc.
* **Floats** are numbers with decimal points, such as 3.14, 2.5, etc.
* **Strings** are sequences of characters enclosed in quotation marks, such as "hello" or "CS101".
* **Booleans** are either True or False.


Here's an example of how to declare variables of different data types:


```python


Integer
=======


x = 5


Float
=====


y = 3.14


String
======


z = "hello"


Boolean
=======


a = True
```


Operators
---------


Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Here are some of the most commonly used operators in Python:


* **Arithmetic operators** are used to perform mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here's an example:


```python


Addition
========


x = 5 + 3


Subtraction
===========


y = 7 - 2


Multiplication
==============


z = 4 \* 6


Division
========


a = 10 / 2
```


* **Comparison operators** are used to compare two values and return a boolean value. Here are some examples:


```python


Equal to
========


x = 5 == 5


Not equal to
============


y = 2 != 5


Greater than
============


z = 10 > 5


Less than
=========


a = 3 < 8


Greater than or equal to
========================


b = 7 >= 7


Less than or equal to
=====================


c = 4 <= 5
```


* **Logical operators** are used to combine multiple boolean expressions. Here are some examples:


```python


AND
===


x = True and False


OR
==


y = True or False


NOT
===


z = not True
```


Conditional Statements
----------------------


Conditional statements are used to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions. Here's an example of an if statement:


```python


If statement
============


x = 5
if x > 3:
 print("x is greater than 3")
```


In this example, the code inside the if statement will only be executed if the condition `x > 3` is True.


Loops
-----


Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Here's an example of a for loop:


```python


For loop
========


for i in range(5):
 print(i)
```


In this example, the code inside the for loop will be executed 5 times, with the variable `i` taking on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.


Conclusion
----------


That's all for today's lesson on Python syntax! We've covered variables and data types, operators, conditional statements, and loops. With these tools, you can start writing simple programs in Python. Keep practicing and you'll be a pro in no time!


Introduction
------------


In this lecture, we will go over some basic Python syntax that you will need to know as a first year computer science student. Python is a popular programming language that is easy to learn and read. It has a simple and intuitive syntax that makes it a great language for beginners.


Example 1: Variables
--------------------


Variables are used to store data in a program. In Python, you can create a variable by assigning a value to it using the equals sign (=). For example:


`x = 5`


This creates a variable named "x" and assigns it the value of 5. You can also assign strings to variables:


`name = "John"`


This creates a variable named "name" and assigns it the value of "John". You can print the value of a variable using the `print()` function:


`print(x)`


This will output the value of x, which is 5.


Example 2: Conditional Statements
---------------------------------


Conditional statements are used to execute code based on certain conditions. In Python, the most common conditional statement is the `if` statement. For example:


`x = 5
if x > 3:
 print("x is greater than 3")`


This code creates a variable named "x" and assigns it the value of 5. It then checks if x is greater than 3 using the `if` statement. If the condition is true, it will execute the code inside the `if` block, which in this case is to print the string "x is greater than 3".


Example 3: Loops
----------------


Loops are used to repeat code multiple times. In Python, the most common loop is the `for` loop. For example:


`for i in range(5):
 print(i)`


This code uses a `for` loop to print the numbers 0 to 4. The `range()` function creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4, and the `for` loop iterates over each number in the sequence and prints it.


Conclusion
----------


These are just a few examples of the basic Python syntax that you will need to know as a first year computer science student. By understanding variables, conditional statements, and loops, you will be well on your way to writing your own Python programs.
