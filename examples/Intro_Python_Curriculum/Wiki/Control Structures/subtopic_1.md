Welcome to the class! Today, we are going to talk about loops. Loops are a fundamental concept in computer science that allow us to repeat a set of instructions multiple times.


To understand loops, let's consider an analogy of making a sandwich. Imagine you are making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You need bread, peanut butter, jelly, and a knife. 


Now, let's write a set of instructions for making a sandwich:


1. Take two slices of bread
2. Spread peanut butter on one slice
3. Spread jelly on the other slice
4. Put the two slices together
5. Cut the sandwich in half


Now, imagine you want to make five sandwiches. You could follow the same set of instructions five times, but that would be tedious and time-consuming. Here's where loops come into play. 


Instead of repeating the same set of instructions five times, we can use a loop to repeat the instructions for us. We can tell the computer to repeat the instructions for as many sandwiches as we want to make. 


So, in our sandwich-making analogy, a loop would be like a chef making multiple sandwiches at once. The chef takes one set of instructions and repeats it for each sandwich. Similarly, a loop takes one set of instructions and repeats it for as many times as we want.


In summary, loops are like a chef making multiple sandwiches at once. They allow us to repeat a set of instructions multiple times without having to write the same code over and over again.


Loops in Python
===============


Loops are an essential part of programming, and they allow us to execute a block of code multiple times. In Python, there are two types of loops: **for** loops and **while** loops. 


For Loops
---------


For loops are used to iterate over a sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string. Let's say we have a list of numbers and we want to print each number in the list. We can use a for loop to accomplish this:


```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


for number in numbers:
 print(number)
```


In this example, we define a list of numbers and then use a for loop to iterate over each number in the list. For each iteration of the loop, we assign the current number to the variable `number`, and then print it to the console.


While Loops
-----------


While loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true. For example, let's say we want to keep asking a user for their name until they enter a non-empty string. We can use a while loop to accomplish this:


```python
name = ""


while len(name) == 0:
 name = input("What is your name? ")


print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```


In this example, we first define an empty string `name`. We then use a while loop to continuously ask the user for their name until they enter a non-empty string. We check the length of the `name` variable using the `len()` function, and if it is equal to 0 (i.e. the string is empty), we continue looping. Once the user enters a non-empty string, the loop exits and we print a greeting to the console.


Conclusion
----------


Loops are a powerful tool in programming, and they allow us to execute a block of code multiple times. By using for loops and while loops, we can iterate over sequences and execute code as long as a condition is true. With a strong understanding of loops, you'll be able to write more efficient and effective programs.


Loops in Computer Science
=========================


Loops are an important concept in computer science that allows us to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. Loops are used in many programming languages to perform repetitive tasks. 


In this section, we'll discuss three examples of how loops can be used in computer science.


Example 1: Printing numbers
---------------------------


One common use of loops is to print numbers. For example, let's say we want to print the numbers 1 through 10. We could write a program like this:


`for i in range(1, 11):
 print(i)`


This program uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to 10. Each time through the loop, the variable `i` is set to the next number in the range, and then that number is printed.


Example 2: Finding the sum of numbers
-------------------------------------


Another use of loops is to find the sum of a series of numbers. For example, let's say we want to find the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10. We could write a program like this:


`sum = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
 sum = sum + i
print("The sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is", sum)`


This program uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to 10. Each time through the loop, the variable `i` is set to the next number in the range, and then that number is added to the variable `sum`. After the loop is finished, the program prints the value of `sum`.


Example 3: Processing data from a list
--------------------------------------


Loops can also be used to process data from a list. For example, let's say we have a list of numbers and we want to find the sum of the even numbers in the list. We could write a program like this:


`numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
sum = 0
for number in numbers:
 if number % 2 == 0:
 sum = sum + number
print("The sum of the even numbers in the list is", sum)`


This program uses a `for` loop to iterate over each number in the list `numbers`. For each number, the program checks if it's even (by using the modulus operator `%`). If the number is even, it's added to the variable `sum`. After the loop is finished, the program prints the value of `sum`.


Loops are a fundamental concept in computer science and are used in many different programming languages and applications. By understanding how to use loops effectively, you'll be able to write more efficient and powerful programs.
