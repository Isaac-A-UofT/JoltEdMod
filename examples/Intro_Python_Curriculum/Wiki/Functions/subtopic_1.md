Good morning everyone, today we are going to talk about function arguments. Think of a function as a recipe for baking a cake. The recipe tells us what ingredients to use and how to mix them together to make a delicious cake. 


Now, imagine that we can change the recipe slightly by adding different ingredients or changing the amounts of some ingredients. Similarly, in a function, we can pass different arguments to change the behavior of the function.


Just like how we can add sugar or salt to the cake recipe to change the flavor of the cake, we can pass arguments to a function to change its behavior. 


For example, we can have a function that calculates the area of a square. We can pass the length of the sides of the square as an argument to the function. If we pass a different value as an argument, we will get a different result.


In summary, function arguments allow us to customize the behavior of a function, just like how adding different ingredients or changing their amounts can change the flavor of a cake.


Function Arguments
==================


In programming, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to break code into smaller, more manageable pieces, and to make code more reusable. A function can take arguments, which are values passed into the function to be used in its execution.


Let's take a look at an example:


`python
def add_numbers(x, y):
 result = x + y
 return result`


In this example, we define a function called `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`. The function adds the values of `x` and `y` together and assigns the result to a variable called `result`. Finally, the function returns the value of `result`.


To use this function, we would call it and pass in two values:


`python
sum = add_numbers(4, 5)
print(sum)`


In this example, we pass in the values `4` and `5` as arguments to the `add_numbers` function. The function adds these values together and returns the result, which we assign to a variable called `sum`. Finally, we print the value of `sum`.


We can also pass variables as arguments to a function:


`python
a = 2
b = 3
sum = add_numbers(a, b)
print(sum)`


In this example, we define two variables `a` and `b`, with values `2` and `3` respectively. We pass these variables as arguments to the `add_numbers` function, which adds them together and returns the result, which we assign to the variable `sum`. Finally, we print the value of `sum`.


Function arguments are a powerful tool that allow us to write reusable code and to tailor the behavior of functions to specific use cases. By passing different values as arguments, we can make the same function perform different tasks, without having to write separate functions for each task.


Function Arguments
==================


Function arguments are the inputs that we can pass to a function. These arguments can help us to customize the behavior of a function. 


Example 1: Print Function
-------------------------


Let's start with a simple example. The `print()` function is a built-in function that you have probably used before. This function takes one or more arguments and prints them to the console. For example, if you want to print the message "Hello, World!" to the console, you can use the following code:


`python
print("Hello, World!")`


Here, the string "Hello, World!" is the argument that we passed to the `print()` function. Without this argument, the `print()` function wouldn't know what to print.


Example 2: Range Function
-------------------------


Another example of a function that takes an argument is the `range()` function. This function generates a sequence of numbers. The argument that we pass to the `range()` function determines the length of the sequence. For example, if we want to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9, we can use the following code:


`python
for i in range(10):
 print(i)`


Here, the argument that we passed to the `range()` function is 10. This means that the `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9 (i.e., it generates 10 numbers in total). The `for` loop then iterates over this sequence of numbers and prints each number to the console.


Example 3: Custom Function
--------------------------


Finally, let's look at an example of a custom function that we define ourselves. Suppose we want to write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the sum of those numbers. We can define this function as follows:


`python
def add_numbers(x, y):
 return x + y`


Here, the `add_numbers()` function takes two arguments (`x` and `y`) and returns their sum. We can call this function with different arguments to get different results. For example:


`python
result = add_numbers(2, 3)
print(result)`


Here, we pass the arguments 2 and 3 to the `add_numbers()` function, and it returns their sum (i.e., 5). We then print the result to the console.


In summary, function arguments are a way to customize the behavior of a function. We can pass different arguments to a function to get different results. Understanding how to use function arguments is an important part of writing effective and efficient code.


1. What is a function argument?
a) A value passed to a function
b) A function passed to another function
c) A variable declared inside a function
d) A function that returns a value
2. What is the purpose of a function argument?

c) A maximum of five
d) It depends on the programming language
4. Which of the following is an example of a default argument?
a) function add(x, y) {return x + y}
b) function greet(name = "World") {console.log("Hello, " + name + "!")}
c) function multiply(x = 1, y = 1) {return x \* y}
d) function subtract(x, y) {return x - y}
5. What happens if a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects?
a) The function will return an error
b) The missing arguments will be assigned a default value
