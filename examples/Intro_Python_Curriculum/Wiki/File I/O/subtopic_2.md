Hello everyone, today we are going to talk about working with directories in computer science. A directory is like a filing cabinet that contains all your files. Just like how you categorize your papers into different folders in your cabinet, directories are used to organize files in a computer.


Think of your computer as a big office that has a lot of cabinets. Each cabinet has multiple drawers and each drawer has different folders. Just like how you need to navigate through different sections of the office to find a specific cabinet, you need to navigate through different directories to find a specific file.


When you want to create a new file, you need to decide which cabinet and folder it belongs to. Similarly, when you want to access a file, you need to know its exact location in the directory structure.


Now, imagine you have a lot of files and folders scattered across different cabinets and drawers. It would be really difficult to find a specific file without a proper organization. This is why directories are very important in computer science as they allow us to keep our files in an organized and easy-to-access manner.


In summary, directories are like filing cabinets that help us organize and locate our files in a computer. Just like how we categorize our papers into different folders in a cabinet, we categorize our files into different directories in a computer.


Working with Directories in Python
----------------------------------


In computer science, a directory is a container or folder in a file system that holds files and other directories. Directories are an essential part of file systems and are used to organize files and folders in a hierarchical manner.


In Python, the `os` module provides a way to work with directories. Let's take a look at an example:


```python
import os


create a new directory
======================


os.mkdir('new\_directory')


change the current working directory
====================================


os.chdir('new\_directory')


create a new file in the new directory
======================================


with open('new\_file.txt', 'w') as f:
 f.write('This is a new file.')


list all files and directories in the current directory
=======================================================


print(os.listdir())


navigate up one level to the parent directory
=============================================


os.chdir('..')


delete the new directory and all its contents
=============================================


os.rmdir('new\_directory')
```


In this example, we first import the `os` module which provides a way to interact with the operating system. We then create a new directory using the `os.mkdir()` function and change the current working directory to the new directory using the `os.chdir()` function.


Next, we create a new file in the new directory using a `with` statement and the `open()` function. This creates a new file object `f` that we can write to using the `write()` function.


We then use the `os.listdir()` function to list all files and directories in the current directory. This returns a list of strings containing the names of all the files and directories in the current directory.


After that, we use `os.chdir()` to navigate up one level to the parent directory. Finally, we delete the new directory and all its contents using the `os.rmdir()` function.


Working with directories in Python is an essential skill for any programmer who deals with file systems. By using the `os` module, we can create, navigate, and delete directories and files with ease.


Working with Directories
========================


As computer scientists, we often deal with files and directories in our work. Directories, also known as folders, are simply containers for files and other directories. In this section, we will discuss how to work with directories in our programs.


Example 1: Creating Directories
-------------------------------


One common task we might encounter is creating new directories in our programs. This is often useful when we need to organize our files in a specific way. In Python, we can create a new directory using the `os` module. Here's an example:


```python
import os


Create a new directory called "my\_folder"
==========================================


os.mkdir("my\_folder")
```


In the above example, we import the `os` module and use the `mkdir` function to create a new directory called "my\_folder". This function takes a single argument, which is the name of the new directory.


Example 2: Listing Directory Contents
-------------------------------------


Another common task we might encounter is listing the contents of a directory. This is often useful when we need to find specific files or directories within a larger directory structure. In Python, we can list the contents of a directory using the `os` module. Here's an example:


```python
import os


List the contents of the current directory
==========================================


contents = os.listdir()


Print the contents of the directory
===================================


print(contents)
```


In the above example, we import the `os` module and use the `listdir` function to list the contents of the current directory. This function takes a single argument, which is the name of the directory to list the contents of. If no argument is provided, it defaults to the current directory.


Example 3: Navigating Directories
---------------------------------


Finally, we might need to navigate through directories in our programs. This is often useful when we need to access files or directories that are not in the current working directory. In Python, we can navigate through directories using the `os` module. Here's an example:


```python
import os


Navigate to a subdirectory called "my\_folder"
==============================================


os.chdir("my\_folder")


List the contents of the "my\_folder" directory
===============================================


contents = os.listdir()


Print the contents of the directory
===================================


print(contents)
```


In the above example, we import the `os` module and use the `chdir` function to navigate to a subdirectory called "my*folder". This function takes a single argument, which is the name of the directory to navigate to. We then use the `listdir` function to list the contents of the "my*folder" directory.


These are just a few examples of how we can work with directories in our programs. As we continue to learn and grow as computer scientists, we will encounter many more situations where knowledge of directories is useful.
