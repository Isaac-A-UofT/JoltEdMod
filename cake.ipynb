    "Welcome, fellas! Today I'm going to talk about the art of baking a cake. Now, I know baking can seem intimidating, but trust me, with the right ingredients and a little bit of patience, anyone can bake a delicious cake that will impress their friends and family.\n",

    "First things first, you'll need to gather your ingredients. For a basic cake, you'll need flour, sugar, eggs, butter, baking powder, and milk. You can also add in your own flavors like vanilla extract or cocoa powder if you want to get creative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you'll want to preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe. While the oven is heating up, you can start mixing your ingredients. Start by creaming together your butter and sugar until they're light and fluffy. Then, add in your eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a separate bowl, mix together your dry ingredients - flour and baking powder. Then, slowly add your dry ingredients to your wet ingredients, mixing until they're well combined. Finally, add in your milk and any other flavorings you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's time to bake your cake! Pour your batter into a greased cake pan and put it in the oven. The baking time will vary based on the size of your cake and the temperature of your oven, so be sure to check it periodically with a toothpick or cake tester. Once it comes out clean, your cake is done!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let your cake cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once it's cooled, you can frost it with your favorite frosting or decorate it with some fresh fruit or sprinkles.\n",

    "As a professor of the culinary arts, I'm going to provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to bake a delicious cake. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, let me tell you that baking a cake is one of the most enjoyable and rewarding experiences in the kitchen. It requires patience, attention to detail, and a little bit of creativity. So, get ready to roll up your sleeves and let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ingredients\n",
    "The first step is to gather all the ingredients. For a basic cake, you'll need the following:\n",
    "- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n",
    "- 2 teaspoons baking powder\n",
    "- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n",
    "- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened\n",
    "- 1 cup white granulated sugar\n",
    "- 2 large eggs\n",
    "- 1 cup whole milk\n",
    "- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directions\n",
    "1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and prepare a 9-inch cake pan by greasing it with butter or cooking spray.\n",
    "2. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.\n",
    "3. In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.\n",
    "4. Add the eggs, one at a time, to the butter mixture, beating well after each addition.\n",
    "5. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix until just combined.\n",
    "6. Stir in the vanilla extract.\n",
    "7. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the surface with a spatula.\n",
    "8. Bake the cake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n",
    "9. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.\n",
    "10. Once the cake is cool, you can frost it with your favorite frosting or serve it plain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips and Tricks\n",
    "- Make sure all of your ingredients are at room temperature before you begin baking. This will ensure that they combine evenly and create a smooth batter.\n",
    "- Use a kitchen scale to measure your ingredients accurately. Baking is a science, and precise measurements are crucial for success.\n",
    "- Don't overmix the batter. Once the flour is added, mix it until just combined. Overmixing can lead to a tough, dense cake.\n",
    "- Keep an eye on your cake as it bakes. Every oven is different, so the baking time may vary. Check the cake after 20 minutes and then every 5 minutes after that.\n",
    "- Let the cake cool completely before frosting it. If the cake is still warm, the frosting will melt and slide off.\n",
    "- Have fun and experiment with different flavors and decorations. Baking is a creative outlet, so don't be afraid to try new things!\n",
    "\n",
    "There you have it, folks! Follow these steps and you'll have a delicious cake in no time. Remember to be patient, pay attention to detail, and most importantly, have fun!"

    "Sure, here's a programming problem related to baking a cake:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a recipe for a cake that requires 'n' ingredients. You want to make the cake for your friend's birthday party, but you only have a limited budget to buy ingredients. You have a list of 'm' stores nearby that sell the ingredients you need. Each store has a price for each ingredient.\n",

    "Write a program to find the cheapest combination of stores from which to buy all the ingredients you need to make the cake. Your program should take as input the number of ingredients, the list of stores and their prices, and the budget you have to buy the ingredients. It should output the combination of stores to buy from and the total cost.\n",

    "For example, suppose the recipe requires 5 ingredients, and you have a budget of $50. You have the following stores nearby:\n",

    "Note that you can buy eggs and flour from Store 2, sugar from Store 1, and milk and vanilla extract from Store 3 to make the cake for the cheapest price of $23.5."
