Chapter 3: Introduction to Conditional Statements in Python


As we know, Python is a powerful programming language that allows us to write code to solve problems. In order to make our programs more dynamic, we often need to make decisions based on certain conditions. This is where conditional statements come in.


Think of a bank. When you want to withdraw money from your account, the bank needs to check if you have enough funds to complete the transaction. If you do, the bank will allow you to withdraw the money. If you don't, the bank will deny the transaction.


Similarly, in programming, conditional statements allow us to check if a certain condition is true or false, and then execute different blocks of code depending on the result of that check. This can help us make our programs more efficient and effective.


In Python, we use if, elif, and else statements to create these conditional statements. These statements allow us to check if a certain condition is true, and if it is, we can execute a block of code. If the condition is false, we can execute a different block of code.


For example, let's say we are writing a program to check if a student has passed a test. We can use an if statement to check if their score is greater than or equal to 70. If it is, we can print a message saying they passed. If it's not, we can print a message saying they failed.


Overall, understanding conditional statements is an important part of programming in Python. It allows us to make decisions and control the flow of our programs, making them more efficient and effective.


Chapter 1: Introduction to Conditional Statements in Python
===========================================================


In Python, we can use conditional statements to make decisions based on certain conditions. 


The If Statement
----------------


The `if` statement is used to check if a certain condition is true or false. If the condition is true, the code inside the if block is executed. If the condition is false, the code inside the if block is skipped.


Here is an example:


```python
x = 5


if x > 0:
 print("x is positive")
```


In this example, we are checking if `x` is greater than 0. Since `x` is 5, which is greater than 0, the code inside the if block is executed and the output is "x is positive".


The Else Statement
------------------


The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code when the `if` statement is false. Here is an example:


```python
x = -5


if x > 0:
 print("x is positive")
else:
 print("x is not positive")
```


In this example, `x` is -5 which is not greater than 0. Therefore, the code inside the if block is skipped and the code inside the else block is executed, which outputs "x is not positive".


The Elif Statement
------------------


The `elif` statement is short for "else if". It allows us to check for multiple conditions. Here is an example:


```python
x = 0


if x > 0:
 print("x is positive")
elif x == 0:
 print("x is zero")
else:
 print("x is negative")
```


In this example, `x` is 0. The first condition (`x > 0`) is false, so we move on to the next condition (`x == 0`). This condition is true, so the code inside the `elif` block is executed and the output is "x is zero".


Conclusion
----------


Conditional statements are an essential part of programming. With the `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements, we can make decisions based on certain conditions. By understanding conditional statements, we can write more efficient and effective code.


Intro to Conditional Statements in Python
=========================================


Conditional statements are an important part of programming in Python. They allow us to write code that can make decisions based on certain conditions. 


Example 1: Temperature Check
----------------------------


Suppose we want to write a program that checks whether the temperature outside is hot or cold. We can use a conditional statement to do this. 


```python
temperature = 75


if temperature > 80:
 print("It's hot outside!")
else:
 print("It's cold outside!")
```


In this example, we are checking whether the temperature is greater than 80. If it is, we print "It's hot outside!". Otherwise, we print "It's cold outside!".


Example 2: Password Check
-------------------------


Another common use for conditional statements is to check whether a user's password is correct. 


```python
password = "password123"


user\_input = input("Enter password: ")


if user\_input == password:
 print("Access granted!")
else:
 print("Access denied.")
```


In this example, we are checking whether the user's input matches the correct password. If it does, we print "Access granted!". Otherwise, we print "Access denied.".


Example 3: Grade Calculation
----------------------------


Conditional statements can also be used to calculate a student's grade based on their score on a test. 


```python
score = 85


if score >= 90:
 grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
 grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
 grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
 grade = "D"
else:
 grade = "F"


print("Your grade is:", grade)
```


In this example, we are using a series of if and elif statements to determine the student's grade based on their score. The first condition checks whether the score is greater than or equal to 90. If it is, the student gets an "A". If not, we move on to the next condition and check whether the score is greater than or equal to 80. If it is, the student gets a "B". We continue in this way until we have checked all of the conditions.


These are just a few examples of how conditional statements can be used in Python. As you continue to learn and write more code, you will find many other cases where they come in handy.
