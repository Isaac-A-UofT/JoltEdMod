Scraping Reddit with Python PRAW Package: A Simple Guide for Humanities Researchers and Social Scientists
=========================================================================================================


Welcome to this simple guide on scraping Reddit data using the Python PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) package. As humanities researchers and social scientists, you may be interested in understanding the discussions, opinions, and trends on various online platforms such as Reddit. With PRAW, you can easily gather and analyze data from Reddit to gain insights into your research topics. Don't worry if you don't have programming experience; we'll use relatable metaphors to help you understand the process.


Introduction: The Library Metaphor
----------------------------------


Imagine Reddit as a vast library with countless books (subreddits) on various topics, and each book contains numerous chapters (posts) with engaging discussions (comments). As researchers, you may want to study specific books, chapters, or even particular discussions. However, manually searching through this library could be time-consuming and challenging.


This is where PRAW comes into play. Think of PRAW as a helpful librarian who can quickly locate the books, chapters, and discussions you're interested in and bring the relevant information right to you. In this guide, we will learn how to ask PRAW to fetch the data we need effectively.


Setting Up: Getting Your Library Card
-------------------------------------


Before PRAW can fetch the information you need, you must first obtain a library card (API credentials) to access the Reddit library. To get your library card, follow these simple steps:


1. Create a Reddit account if you don't have one already.
2. Go to the [Reddit App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and click on the "Create App" or "Create Another App" button.
3. Fill in the application form with the required details (name, description, etc.) and select "script" as the app type. After completing the form, click on "Create app."


You should now see your new app listed with a "client ID" and "client secret." These, along with your Reddit account's username and password, will serve as your library card for accessing Reddit data with PRAW.


Accessing Reddit: Entering the Library
--------------------------------------


Now that you have your library card (API credentials), you can enter the Reddit library using PRAW. To do this, you'll need to install the PRAW package and import it into your Python script. You can install PRAW using the following command:


`python
pip install praw`


Once PRAW is installed, you can use it to access Reddit by providing your library card (API credentials) like this:


```python
import praw


reddit = praw.Reddit(client*id="your*client*id",
 client*secret="your*client*secret",
 user*agent="your*app*name",
 username="your*reddit*username",
 password="your*reddit\_password")
```


With this setup, PRAW can now access the Reddit library on your behalf.


Exploring Subreddits: Browsing the Bookshelves
----------------------------------------------


To study a particular topic, you'd first need to locate the relevant book (subreddit) in the library. With PRAW, you can easily access specific subreddits by providing their names:


`python
subreddit = reddit.subreddit("SubredditName")`


Now that you've found the book you're interested in, you can explore its chapters (posts) or even focus on the most popular or most recent ones, depending on your research goals.


Analyzing Posts: Reading the Chapters
-------------------------------------


Once you've selected a subreddit, you can start reading its posts. You can think of each post as a chapter in the book, which may contain text, images, or links to other resources. You can use PRAW to fetch posts based on different criteria:


* Hot posts: The most popular and trending posts.
* New posts: The most recent posts.
* Top posts: The highest-rated posts of all time or within a specific time frame (day, week, month, year).


For example, to fetch the top 10 hot posts in a subreddit, you can use the following code:


`python
top_hot_posts = subreddit.hot(limit=10)`


Delving into Comments: Engaging in Discussions
----------------------------------------------


Each post (chapter) may have various comments (discussions) that you'd like to analyze further. With PRAW, you can easily access the comments within a post and gather valuable insights. You can even sort the comments by popularity or chronological order.


For example, to fetch the top-level comments from a post, you can use the following code:


```python
post = reddit.submission(id="postId")


for top*level*comment in post.comments:
 print(top*level*comment.body)
```


Conclusion: Closing the Book
----------------------------


By following this simple guide, you can now use Python PRAW to access Reddit's vast library and gather valuable data for your research. Remember, PRAW is a powerful tool that can help you explore and analyze Reddit's countless subreddits, posts, and comments in a structured manner.


Scraping Reddit with Python PRAW Package
========================================


Hello, humanities researchers and social scientists! Today, we're going to learn how to scrape Reddit using the Python PRAW package. Don't worry if you're new to programming - I'll guide you step by step through the process. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to gather data from Reddit for your research projects.


What is PRAW?
-------------


PRAW stands for "Python Reddit API Wrapper." It's a Python package that makes it easy to access and interact with Reddit's API, allowing you to collect data from the site programmatically. PRAW is perfect for researchers and social scientists who want to analyze Reddit data without spending hours manually browsing and collecting information.


Setting up PRAW
---------------


Before we start, you need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python yet, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


Once you have Python installed, open your terminal (or command prompt for Windows users) and install the PRAW package by typing:


`bash
pip install praw`


Creating a Reddit App
---------------------


To use PRAW, you need to create a Reddit "app" that will give you access to the API. Here's how to do that:


1. Log in to your Reddit account or create a new one.
2. Go to <https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps> and click "Create App" or "Create Another App" at the bottom of the page.
3. Fill in the following details:
	* "name": Choose a name for your app.
	* "App type": Select "script."
	* "description": Write a short description of your app (optional).
	* "about url" and "redirect uri": Leave these blank.
	* "permissions": Leave as default (read).
4. Click "Create app," and you'll see your new app in the "Developed Applications" section.


Take note of the "client ID" (a string of random characters below the app name) and "client secret" (another string of characters). You'll need these to authenticate your Python script with the PRAW package.


Writing the Code
----------------


Now that you have everything set up, let's write some code! Open your favorite text editor or IDE, and create a new Python file (e.g., `reddit_scraper.py`).


First, let's import the PRAW package and authenticate your app:


```python
import praw


client*id = "your*client*id*here"
client*secret = "your*client*secret*here"
user*agent = "your*app*name*here"


Authenticate with Reddit using PRAW
===================================


reddit = praw.Reddit(client*id=client*id,
 client*secret=client*secret,
 user*agent=user*agent)
```


Replace `your_client_id_here`, `your_client_secret_here`, and `your_app_name_here` with the respective values from your Reddit app.


Now let's write a function to extract the top posts from a given subreddit:


```python
def get*top*posts(subreddit*name, num*posts=10):
 """
 This function extracts the top posts from a subreddit.



```
:param subreddit_name: The name of the subreddit you want to scrape.
:param num_posts: The number of top posts you want to extract (default is 10).
:return: A list of dictionaries containing information about the top posts.
"""

# Access the specified subreddit
subreddit = reddit.subreddit(subreddit_name)

# Get the top posts
top_posts = subreddit.top(limit=num_posts)

# Extract information about each post
post_data = []
for post in top_posts:
    data = {
        "title": post.title,
        "score": post.score,
        "url": post.url,
        "author": str(post.author),
        "created_utc": post.created_utc,
    }
    post_data.append(data)

return post_data

```

```


Now, let's test our function by extracting the top 5 posts from the /r/AskHistorians subreddit:


```python
if **name** == "**main**":
 subreddit*name = "AskHistorians"
 num*posts = 5
 top*posts = get*top*posts(subreddit*name, num\_posts)



```
for i, post in enumerate(top_posts, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {post['title']} (Score: {post['score']})")

```

```


Save your Python file, and then run the script in your terminal/command prompt:


`bash
python reddit_scraper.py`


You should see the titles and scores of the top 5 posts from /r/AskHistorians printed in the terminal.


That's it! You've successfully scraped data from Reddit using the PRAW package. You can now use this code as a starting point for your research projects, such as analyzing trends in discussions, sentiment analysis, or any other topic that interests you

After creating your app, you'll receive a "client*id" and a "client*secret." Keep these handy, as you'll need them to authenticate your Python script.


Example 1: Collecting Posts from a Specific Subreddit
=====================================================


In this example, we'll scrape the top 10 posts from the "AskReddit" subreddit. Here's how to do it:


1. Create a new Python script or Jupyter Notebook and import the required packages:


`python
import praw`


2. Add your Reddit app credentials and authenticate your script:


`python
reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id="your_client_id",
 client_secret="your_client_secret",
 user_agent="your_app_name")`


Remember to replace "your*client*id," "your*client*secret," and "your*app*name" with your actual credentials.


3. Access the "AskReddit" subreddit and collect the top 10 posts:


```python
subreddit = reddit.subreddit("AskReddit")


top\_posts = subreddit.top(limit=10)


for post in top\_posts:
 print(post.title, post.score)
```


This script will print the title and score of the top 10 posts in the "AskReddit" subreddit.


Example 2: Gathering Comments from a Particular Post
====================================================


In this example, we'll extract the top 5 comments from a specific Reddit post. To do this, follow these steps:


1. Get the post's URL and replace "www.reddit.com" with "old.reddit.com" to access the post's unique ID.
2. Use the unique ID in the following Python script:


```python
post*id = "your*post*id"
post = reddit.submission(id=post*id)


post.comments.replace*more(limit=0)
top*comments = post.comments.list()[:5]


for comment in top\_comments:
 print(comment.body)
```


Remember to replace "your*post*id" with the actual post ID. This script will print the top 5 comments from the specified post.


Example 3: Analyzing User Activity
==================================


In this example, we'll extract information about a Reddit user's recent activity. Here's how:


1. Choose a Reddit username and use it in the following Python script:


```python
username = "your\_username"
user = reddit.redditor(username)


for submission in user.submissions.new(limit=5):
 print("Title:", submission.title)
 print("Score:", submission.score)
 print("Subreddit:", submission.subreddit.display\_name)
 print("\n")
```


Remember to replace "your\_username" with the actual Reddit username. This script will print the title, score, and subreddit of the user's five most recent posts.
