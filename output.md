Welcome to today's lecture on conditionals in Python. As a first-year computer science student, you may find yourself asking, what exactly are conditionals? Well, think of it this way: you wake up in the morning and look outside, trying to decide what to wear for the day. The weather outside will determine your decision on what clothes to wear. If it's raining, you'll grab your raincoat, and if it's sunny, you'll wear a t-shirt and shorts.


Similarly, in Python, a conditional statement is used to make decisions based on certain conditions. If a condition is true, the program will execute one set of instructions, and if it's false, it will execute a different set of instructions. Just like how you make a decision on what to wear based on the weather outside.


For instance, let's say we want to write a program that will check if a number is even or odd. We can use a conditional statement to do this. If the number is even, the program will print "The number is even," and if it's odd, it will print "The number is odd."


In conclusion, conditionals are an integral part of programming and help us make decisions based on certain conditions. Just like how you make decisions in your everyday life based on certain conditions. I hope this metaphor has helped you understand conditionals in Python better.


Introduction to Conditionals in Python
======================================


Welcome, first year computer science students! Today, we will be discussing a fundamental concept in programming: conditionals. 


In programming, conditionals are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. In Python, we use the `if` statement to create conditionals. 


Syntax of `if` statement
------------------------


The syntax of the `if` statement in Python is as follows:


`python
if condition:
 # if block of code`


Here, `condition` is the expression that is evaluated to a Boolean value (`True` or `False`). If the condition is true, then the code inside the `if` block is executed. 


Example Code
------------


Let's take a look at an example code to better understand how conditionals work in Python. 


```python


Program to check if a number is positive or negative
====================================================


num = float(input("Enter a number: "))


if num > 0:
 print("The number is positive")
else:
 print("The number is negative")
```


In this program, we have a variable `num` that takes input from the user. We then use an `if` statement to check if `num` is greater than zero. If `num` is greater than zero, then the message "The number is positive" is printed. If `num` is not greater than zero (i.e., it is less than or equal to zero), then the message "The number is negative" is printed. 


Conclusion
----------


That's it for today's lecture on conditionals in Python. Remember, conditionals are used to make decisions based on certain conditions in programming. In Python, we use the `if` statement to create conditionals. The syntax of the `if` statement in Python is `if condition:`, where `condition` is the expression that is evaluated to a Boolean value (`True` or `False`). If the condition is true, then the code inside the `if` block is executed.


Introduction
------------


Welcome everyone to the lecture on conditionals in Python. In this lecture, we will discuss the concept of conditionals in programming and how we can use them in Python. 


What are Conditionals?
----------------------


Conditionals are a way to tell a program what to do based on a condition. In other words, we can use conditionals to make decisions in our programs. The most common type of conditional in programming is the if statement. An if statement allows us to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. 


Example 1: Temperature Conversion
---------------------------------


Let's take the example of temperature conversion. Suppose we want to write a program that converts the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Here's how we can use conditionals to achieve this:


```python
fahrenheit = 86


if fahrenheit > 32:
 celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) \* 5 / 9
 print("The temperature in Celsius is:", celsius)
else:
 print("The temperature is below freezing.")
```


In this example, the program checks if the temperature is above freezing (32 degrees Fahrenheit). If it is, then the program calculates the temperature in Celsius and prints it. If it's not, then the program prints a message saying that the temperature is below freezing.


Example 2: Password Validation
------------------------------


Another example where we can use conditionals is in password validation. Suppose we want to write a program that validates a user's password based on certain criteria. Here's how we can use conditionals to achieve this:


```python
password = "password123"


if len(password) >= 8 and any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
 print("Password is valid.")
else:
 print("Password is invalid.")
```


In this example, the program checks if the password is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one digit. If it does, then the program prints a message saying that the password is valid. If it doesn't, then the program prints a message saying that the password is invalid.


Example 3: Grade Calculation
----------------------------


Let's take the example of grade calculation. Suppose we want to write a program that calculates a student's grade based on their score. Here's how we can use conditionals to achieve this:


```python
score = 85


if score >= 90:
 grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
 grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
 grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
 grade = "D"
else:
 grade = "F"


print("The student's grade is:", grade)
```


In this example, the program checks the student's score and assigns a grade based on the score. If the score is greater than or equal to 90, then the student gets an A. If the score is between 80 and 89, then the student gets a B, and so on.


Conclusion
----------


In conclusion, conditionals are an important part of programming and allow us to make decisions in our programs based on certain conditions. We can use conditionals in a variety of ways, such as temperature conversion, password validation, and grade calculation, as we have seen in the examples above.
