    "# Python Basics: The Building Blocks of Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are building a house. To do this, you would need a variety of materials and tools to create the structure, design, and functionality of the house. Similarly, when you are learning Python or any other programming language, you need to understand its basic building blocks. In this lesson, we will discuss the fundamental concepts of Python: Syntax, Variables, Data Types, and Control Flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax: The Language of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When you speak with your friends, you use a specific language with rules and structure. The same applies to programming languages like Python. The syntax is the set of rules that dictate how Python code should be written and structured. Just like how grammar and punctuation are essential in writing English, syntax is crucial in writing Python code. Understanding Python syntax allows you to communicate effectively with the computer to execute your desired tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables: The Containers of Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand how to communicate with Python, let's discuss variables. Think of variables as containers or boxes that store information. In the context of our house metaphor, variables are like the rooms in a house, each holding different items or functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can assign values to variables. These values can be numbers, text, or even more complex data structures such as lists or dictionaries. The ability to store and manipulate data in variables is a fundamental concept in programming, as it allows you to keep track of information and use it in various ways throughout your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types: The Building Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as a house is built with different materials like wood, bricks, and glass, Python has various data types that represent different kinds of information. The basic data types in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integers**: Whole numbers, like the number of rooms in a house.\n",
    "2. **Floats**: Decimal numbers, like the length of a room in meters.\n",
    "3. **Strings**: Text, like the names of the rooms.\n",
    "4. **Booleans**: True or False values, like whether a room has a window or not.\n",
    "5. **Lists**: A collection of items, like a list of furniture in each room.\n",
    "6. **Tuples**: Similar to lists, but immutable (cannot be changed), like the fixed dimensions of a room.\n",
    "7. **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, like a room's name and its corresponding area in square meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these data types and how they can be used together is essential for building more complex programs and solving real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control Flow: The Blueprint of Your Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have control flow. Just as an architect creates a blueprint to guide the construction of a house, control flow provides a roadmap for your Python code. It dictates the order in which the code is executed and allows you to make decisions and repeat actions in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three primary types of control flow in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conditional Statements**: These are like forks in the road, where your program can take different paths based on specific conditions. For example, if a room has a window, then you would install curtains; otherwise, you would not.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loops**: These allow you to repeat actions or iterate through items in a list. For example, you could go through each room in your house and turn off the lights.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Functions**: Functions are reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task. For instance, a function might calculate the total area of your house by multiplying the length and width of each room.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding and using control flow, you can create more efficient and organized code that can handle complex tasks and adapt to different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we have covered the fundamentals of Python: Syntax, Variables, Data Types, and Control Flow. These concepts are the building blocks for creating Python programs, just as materials, tools, and blueprints are needed to build a house. As you continue your journey in learning Python, remember these basics and practice using them to create more complex and powerful programs."

    "# Python Basics: Syntax, Variables, Data Types, and Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome, first-year computer science students! Today, we'll be exploring the basics of Python, a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language. We will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax\n",
    "2. Variables\n",
    "3. Data Types\n",
    "4. Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's syntax is designed to be highly readable, making it a great choice for beginners. It uses indentation to define code blocks, unlike other programming languages that use braces or brackets. Here's an example of Python's syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x > y:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than y\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is less than or equal to y\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Python uses colons and indentation to define code blocks. This makes the code easy to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are used to store values in a program. In Python, you can create a variable by simply assigning a value to a name, without needing to declare its type explicitly. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have created two variables: an integer variable `x` with the value `5`, and a string variable `name` with the value `\"Alice\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in data types that you'll commonly use in your programs. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integers**: Whole numbers, like `42` or `-7`.\n",
    "- **Floats**: Decimal numbers, like `3.14` or `-0.001`.\n",
    "- **Strings**: Sequences of characters, like `\"hello\"` or `'world'`.\n",
    "- **Booleans**: The truth values `True` and `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "integer_example = 42\n",
    "float_example = 3.14\n",
    "string_example = \"hello\"\n",
    "boolean_example = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has built-in data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries, which we'll discuss in future lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Control flow statements allow you to create more complex programs by controlling the flow of execution of your code. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 If Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement is used to conditionally execute a block of code. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = 7\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > y:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than y\")\n",
    "elif x < y:\n",
    "    print(\"x is less than y\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is equal to y\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code. Python has two types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.1 For Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "`For` loops are used to iterate over a sequence, like a list or a string. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.2 While Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "`While` loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while counter < 5:\n",
    "    print(counter)\n",
    "    counter += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a brief introduction to Python basics! Remember, practice is key to mastering any programming language, so keep experimenting and building small projects to solidify your understanding. Happy coding!"

    "**Problem: Temperature Conversion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python program that converts a given temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. The program should take the input of the temperature value and its unit (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit). It should then perform the conversion and print the result in the appropriate unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- An integer `temperature` (-100 <= temperature <= 100)\n",
    "- A character `unit` ('C' or 'F')\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A string displaying the converted temperature value followed by the new unit (e.g., \"32F\" or \"0C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function signature:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def temperature_conversion(temperature: int, unit: str) -> str:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temperature_conversion(0, 'C')\n",
    "# Output: \"32F\"\n",
    "\n",
    "temperature_conversion(32, 'F')\n",
    "# Output: \"0C\"\n",
    "\n",
    "temperature_conversion(100, 'C')\n",
    "# Output: \"212F\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, use the formula: `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`\n",
    "- To convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, use the formula: `C = (F - 32) * 5/9`\n",
    "- Round the converted temperature to the nearest integer. You can use the `round()` function in Python for this purpose.\n",
    "- Make sure to handle the input case-insensitively, i.e., the program should work for both 'C' and 'c', as well as 'F' and 'f'."
